text=Yet another sub-tempo genre. Stuff that's not cool cat daddy-o or saxaphoney enough for Acid Jazz, yet not drearily drolling enough (nor from Bristol) to be Trip Hop. This was huge in the mid 90s. And then it tapered off, like most things do. I don't even know if it's called Downbeat or not. But I'm calling it here, because it has to fit somewhere, and putting the music in either of the other genres is just wrong. It's funny how I'll get emails about this now; half of them saying I'm being way too scrutinizing and specific, and the other half complaining that I'm not being specific enough because I missed Ambient Down Dub Hopcore. Sheesh.
