text=This music fucking kicks ass!!! This is also Dr. Dre's secret stash. Whenever he's stuck for a drop or a hook in a groove, he will undoubtedly return to the well--the electro funk period of the early 80s--and rip off something by Zapp and Roger. Thomas Bangalter too. The kings of the vocoders and talk boxes are here! What differentiates it from electro? Well, less emphasis on the rapping/hip hopping, and greater emphasis on its direct parent: DA FUNK! And the beat is less syncopated; it's actually a 4/4 groove (shouldn't this be in the House section then?) By the 80s, big horn section funk bands were out, and synthesizers were in. Let robot funk reign supreme!
