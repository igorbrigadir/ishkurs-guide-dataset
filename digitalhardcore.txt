text=Punk-infused Hardcore. It's really just the sound of one guy (Alec Empire) and then maybe others who come into contact with him. It's also got that radical, anti-authoritarian edge that angsty rebellious teenager types seem to love so much. Basically thrash metal with drum machines. If you can make out what anyone is saying in any of their tracks, you've gotten further along in it than I have. Though on cool summer days some Atari Teenage Riot can be very refreshing!
