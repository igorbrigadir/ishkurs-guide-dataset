text=You know that creepy surreal music during the end credits of Apocalypse Now? That's like proto Dark Ambient. Halloween music. Horror movie music. Where Ambient is sweet and zen-like in it's mood, Dark Ambient is abrasive and mean-spirited. This is what they call Ambient music in hell. Creepy sound effects and evil movie soundtracks and the like. I think a good idea would be to put prisoners in a doorless cell with this playing 24 hours a day and totally freak them out. Or maybe lock the doors of a chill room (if it has doors) at a party, trapping everyone inside, and subject them to this. Bad trips ensue. Oh yes. Yes, that would do very nicely.
