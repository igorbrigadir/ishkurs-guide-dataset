text=Yes. The sound that launched an entire cultural movement. Given that this device was originally intended to sound like a bass guitar, I would say that the engineers completely missed the mark. And that may have been the best thing that's ever happened to music. This little box (only 30cm long) makes the First Sound of Electronica, and the loveliest, most versatile sound of all time: acid. Through proper tweaking, it can be warm, cold, stiff, funky, dark, happy, soft, fuzzy, trippy, screaming, squelching, driving, pulsing, rubbery, or anything you've ever possibly heard of (and even things you haven't). It can be smooth and bubbly, like a drinking fountain or boiling hot springs. Or it can be cold and mechanical, like an automotive assembly line on the bridge of the Star Trek Enterprise. But perhaps the most important thing about its mutated, alien-like din is that its really really cool to listen to on drugs. That combination--warped acid music and amphetamines--has gone on to spawn the greatest single form of all-night recreation yet conceived of by man.
