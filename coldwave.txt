text=Coldwave is really pissed off about something, but I'm still trying to figure out what that is. It basically takes the angst of Darkwave and turns it up a notch (where Darkwave takes the angst of Goth and turns it up a notch). So this is like Goth...TO THE EXTREME!!! But it loves using acid, so it can't be all bad. And it loves using guitars, being a stepping stone to the more commercial-friendly Industrial Rock.
