text=You know a genre is really popular in the music press when it quickly garners more names than it does actual artists or labels. The reason for this is because every major player in the music press wants to lay claim to discovering something so kitsch and trendy by giving it their own pet term for it--a foreshadow of things to come as music continues to fragment into social niches. I am no different, which is why I call it 'Synthtron', because Electroclash sounds like the stupidest name I've ever heard. Though it may more be appropriately applied to the grittier, guitar-infused punk artists (Chicks on Speed, Fischerspooner, Add N to (X), Orgy), I can't see it being a justifiable term for their House-bred contemporaries (Felix da Housekat, Miss Kitten and the Hacker, Ladytron, Adult., Who da Funk, Northern Lite) who are, once again, following the wake of pioneers Thomas Bangalter and Les Rythmes Digitales, who were spearheading this retro 80s trend back in 1996. Heh. Synthpop with upgraded equipment. Who could've seen that coming?
