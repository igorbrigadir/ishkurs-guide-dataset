text=Downtempo isn't dance music, it is listening music. For 40 years it has dedicated itself to the exploration of new audio textures and undiscovered sonic soundscapes, often inventing whole instruments and sound kaleidoscopes in its push for novelty. Because of this, the other genres have made a habit of consistently and constantly raiding the atmospheric mood and ambience of Downtempo to employ in their own eclectic styles. But though it doesn't actively seek the spotlight as much as the others, Downtempo will remain as the genre that was here first and will probably be here at the end, since it is the only one driven solely by an insatiable desire for innovation.
