text=Japan actually has a pretty storied history with eletronical type music stuffs, going all the way back in the day with Yellow Magic Orchestra and other super crazy fun full of many surprise names like that. It probably has something to do with their tendancy to deify technology, especially the kind that doesn't exist yet, like giant robots who dispense schoolgirl panties that try to take over the world by blowing up Neo-Tokyo III. Those zany Japanese are never tiring to watch.
