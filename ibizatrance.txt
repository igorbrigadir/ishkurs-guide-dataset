text=This is the only genre I would trust with any uplifting, euphoric melodies. There's a stark contrast between this and the forced-upon, pompous schlock that seeps out of the Epic Trance. I'm not sure why, but without ever having been there this music seems to capture the mood of a soft, Mediterranean sunset perfectly. Soft and wistful music without being trite and limp. It's probably because of its use of string instruments, like spanish guitars and mandolins and other Mediterraneany things, like oceans, birds, and other things borrowed from Ambient Trance. This genre is actually much, much older. It came out of Balearic House in the 80s, and named after the Spanish island that is now an expensive, overcrowded trashy tourist trap.
