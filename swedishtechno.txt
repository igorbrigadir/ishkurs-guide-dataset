text=This is what people should think of when they DO hear the word "techno". Something completely and totally machine-oriented, using drum patterns and rhythms as melody. After awhile, it actually begins to sound like it, too. Cool eh? If the Americans don't watch out their European counterparts are going to start making their music better than them (if they aren't already). And Americans hate it when they get upstaged. Sweden already conquers the world's pop music (90 percent of all boy band/popgirl producers are swedish). They also make great furniture, produce kickass hockey players, and have good looking women. Gee. Is there anything that country CAN'T do? I want to move there someday.
