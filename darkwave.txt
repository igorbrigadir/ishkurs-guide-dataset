text=Everything was "wave" in the 80s. There was New Wave in pop music, and then No Wave in punk music, and then the Third Wave of Alan Toffler, and then there was the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and also everyone's hair had impressively feathered waves in it. It was certainly a time of waving (it took them awhile to change the 'w' to an 'r'). So when the goths finally decided that their melodrama would work really well with machines, of course they called it Darkwave. They probably wanted to call it Blackwave, but that.....hey, why didn't they call it that? I guess it beats calling it Electro-goth (some people might tell you there is a difference between the two genres, but don't listen to them). Lately, it has splintered into regional styles, like Euro Darkwave, and American Darkwave, and man, they are amplified trauma on a whole different, unheard of level. I swear, they make Linkin Park and Evanescence's bellowing about stupid insignificant shit sound like pillow talk.
