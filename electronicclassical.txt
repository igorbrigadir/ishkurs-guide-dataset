text=At the outset, no one was really sure whether to call these electronic sound things musical instruments. I mean...could you play them? Like...with a band? No one had really tried. But just to see if it was possible, many of them did, creating experimental covers of classical compositions entirely using electronics. Of course that horrified the purists, but fascinated their colleagues who said "shit, this stuff really can make music". In a limited way. But it took them awhile to figure out that making music the old fashion way with electronic equipment, while possible, wasn't utilizing the things to the best of their capabilities. It was like using a 747 to go to the grocery store. But once they worked out the kinks, they came out with some very memorable results.
