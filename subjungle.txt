text=Tone down the silliness of Oldskool Rave Hardcore and maybe add a string section or two--sans Jamaican vocals--and you have Jungle, the raw, uncut purity of the sound before it developed all those "steps" cookie cutter drum preset patterns. More than the other genres (even techno), Jungle artists tend to be all over the map. They will release a soulful Jazzy track one week, and then an evil, growling track the next. They don't worry about pet genres or niche sounds too much. Everything is fair game.
