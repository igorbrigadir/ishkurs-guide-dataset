text=Trance is the most emotional genre. It can make you cry, make you shout, make you cheer, and make you celebrate absolutely nothing of substance except pure, ecstatic bliss. This is interesting, when at one time it was very repetitive and hypnotic (hence its label 'trance') and was very easy to get lost in whilst divulging in aforementioned emotions. But now it's quite difficult to get entranced due mostly to the fact that the genre has devolved into such trite, derivative junk that even the biggest culprits of it are having trouble lying about how interesting it is. If you ignore the cliched, breakdown-build-anthem template side of the genre that is so canned and predictable you can set your watch to it, trance is still pretty fun. Unless you're trying to be a Sasha worshipping pretentious snob not partaking in that, in which case you don't even want to admit you're listening to trance anymore.
