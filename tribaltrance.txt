text=Technically all trance is tribal at a ritualistic level, it being the one musical genre that is simultaneously sacred and profane, blissed-out and dreadful, stupid fun and spiritually deep. Tribal Trance, ironically, seems like none of those things. But it is fun to dance to on a nude beach somewhere with a full moon overhead. I fully recommend it. It's too bad it doesn't get much playtime these days anymore. Not even at goa parties.
