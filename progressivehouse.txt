text=Alright, this progressive nonsense has got to stop. You do not make yourself intelligent and creative by using that word. Instead, you make yourself out to be haughty and pretentious. That makes you no better than the french. This goes for progressive rock, progressive house, progressive trance, progressive progress, and even progressive itself. Kill the word already. It means nothing. With that said, Progressive House is a genre originally coined by Genesis P'Orridge to describe the early 90s sound made by artists like Leftfiend (actually, only just Leftfield), which was not quite house and not quite techno and not quite dance. In truth, it really just sounded like house with (then) trancey elements. Not trance with housey elements. I don't know what it meant after that (probably Progressive Trance), but that doesn't mean you can hi-jack the word now and call yourself forward-thinking. Especially since the genre is STILL BEING MADE (the 'X-press 2' track came from 2002, not 1992). There's a lot more to music than trying to look and feel important, trancecrackers.
