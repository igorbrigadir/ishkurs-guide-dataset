text=Ah yes, here we go: Electronic Body Music. Almost like proto-goa, in its straight-ahead, buzzing synth aesthete. Industrial's true connection to trance, which is why the rest of the genres kinda got dragged with it in this mangled mess of a music genre node. In its raw form here, it's pretty mean, impersonal stuff. I'm not sure how some people can insist that trance is peaceful, euphoric angel music. That's like saying Charles Manson is the next Mother Teresa. Machines don't have feelings, and neither does trance.
