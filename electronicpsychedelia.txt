text=As soon as it was confirmed that electronic instruments were useful for something other than elating math geeks, the spacey, avant-garde weirdness they were known for was picked up by the psychedelic community, who employed them lavishly because, well, since psychedelic music contains no real substance, all it's got going for it are freaky textures, which electronic music is best at. Pink Floyd aka "that sound effects band" became famous for this reason, but the group that really kicked things off were The Beatles with their track "Tomorrow Never Knows", which may very well be the most important track in electronic music history, simply for the Musique Concrete techniques it used which, to society at large, was utterly bizarre. In the 70s, this genre split into Space Rock, Krautrock and Progressive Rock. They might be listed here someday, but don't bet on it.
