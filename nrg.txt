text=It's actually really decent in small doses. Being forced to endure an entire set of it will grate on you, however, and having to go through an ENTIRE NIGHT of it--as I was victim to, many many times--gets excruciatingly mundane. The problem is the music just doesn't let up--ever--and no, you stupid ravers, that is not a good thing. Parties build on tension and release; NRG's go-go-go ethic just flatlines the entire experience, with track after track after track of the same idiotic shit. There are a group of genres that pride themselves under the monicker Hard Dance (which includes Happy Hardcore, Trancecore, Freeform, and Stupid House) and are harbingers of a culture infatuated with its own attitude that, given the chance, will set your teeth on edge even more than the music will. Best to just ignore them. They're too high on crystal and nordic-tracking to NRG music to pay much attention anyway.
