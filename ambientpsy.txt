text=Ambient Psy. More like Ambient *SIGH*. Ha ha ha.  This is what happens when Psy Trance producers get bored of the 4/4 pulse-drum and so remove it altogether....maybe by replacing it with lowkey breakbeats or something. Ultimately musicians of all genres are going to figure out that they can make slower, more moody versions of their music, which means that sooner or later there's going to be Ambient 2-step here, and Ambient Hardcore, and Ambient NRG, and Ambient Freestyle, and Ambient Ambient. Well, it could've been worse. It could have been "Progressive Psy". (No, I'm not adding it, you goa turds. Shut the hell up)
