text=History has since given it the name Oldskool Rave Hardcore, but back then it was called rave (not to be confused with its Rave predecessor. Yes, they were both called Rave. No, I won't explain why). The difference between the two? Simple: Rave is the precursor to modern Hardcore. THIS is the precursor to modern Jungle/Drum n Bass (and Happy Hardcore). In the early 90s this is what was real RAVE music. It dominated the oldskool underground scene with spastic beats and chipmunk female vocals--influencing all latter ventures into jungle and happy hardcore. There was a sub-sub-genre of this that split-off around 93-94 that got really fucking silly, with samples of children, cartoons, and nursery rhymes, called Toytown for its infantilism. It gave birth to Candy Ravers, and I've included two samples of it here (you'll know which ones they are. No, trust me).
