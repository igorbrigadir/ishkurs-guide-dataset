text=Yeah, there we go. Real _FUCKING_ Hard House. To even remotely hint at suggesting that Hard House is some other kind of limp-wristed pussy circus music makes you ridiculously dumb. I mean it: you are really really DUMB for fostering the delusion that Hard House should be anything other than.....HARD. A distorted 909 bassdrum is what you need. And some courses on how to properly focus your anger management, and hopping around pumping your fist in the air.
