text=You BETTER KNOW what this is, otherwise you have no conception of the oddity that people ironically giggle about called "the 80s". Taking the explorations of New Wave and the feelgood rhythms of Italo Disco, Synthpop--in all its androgeny--makes as warm a sound as archaic 80s electronic instruments can get. Melodic hooks, pop lines, all the tools of the trade are there, only this time with synthesizers. MIDI definitely contributed to this explosion. And now its undergoing a renaissance due to the almighty power of Retro. But its crowning moment will always be the Carnival scene in Revenge of the Nerds, proving that the geeks and social outcasts were, are, and will forever be the ones spearheading modern cultural movements. I personally feel Italo is way better though.
