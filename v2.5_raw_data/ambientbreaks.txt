text=It's really hard to discern exactly what constitutes Ambient Breaks when most of the music is claimed by either the Illbient or Trip Hop or even the Worldbeat crowd. That makes this, by comparison, smaller than the other Ambient genres. That, and also the fact that the breaks scene is much too snobby to admit that it's music can be associated with something calming and melodic like ambient. That's why Jungle doesn't have one. Atmospheric is about as close as it's willing to get. So where would one normally find Ambient Breaks? Why, in car commercials and movie soundtracks, of course.
