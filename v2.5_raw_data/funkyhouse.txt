text=Yes, officially sanctioned by the Department of Redundancy Department, it's Funky House! Since when is House Music not funky? Well, when it's doing something else, I guess. Still, this and Deep House are easily the strongest genres, because they encapsulate best what House music represents: groovy soul. Well, I suppose there's a Soul House genre somewhere as well, but for the time being all soulful house gets squeezed into here. Or Vocal House. Point is if you aren't moving at least ONE PART OF YOUR BODY RIGHT NOW (even a head bobbing), then you just don't get it. House music is not for you. Go pick up a craft project or something.
