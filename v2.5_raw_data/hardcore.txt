text=Hardcore is the musical genre with bi-polar disorder: one half is blistering, sadistic anger, a seething uncontrollable rage that seeks to ruin and wreck everything that exists, including everyone else's fun time. It is hardcore's mission to inundate the world with pointless, seering sonic hell, insisting every chance it gets that it will never be defeated, can not be killed, and refuses to go away no matter how much people want it to. The other half of hardcore is way too silly and stupid to take such anger seriously anymore.
