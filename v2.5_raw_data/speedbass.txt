text=What is Speedbass? Your guess is as good as mine. As near as I can figure, it is defined as the genre that has no official definition. These tracks are the first tracks I pulled off the random downloads section of speedbass.net (for ALL your speedbass needs!) and they're as good a representation of the genre as any. Emerging from the mid 90s as a kind of west coast hardcore collective type thing, Speedbass seems to be mostly satirical music, and ranks beside glitch in its gleeful rape, stealing and butchering of pop music tracks. These guys are the best. They're the kind of cool mofos that you'd want to hang out for a weekend at their place, drink beer and make weird, stupid music.
