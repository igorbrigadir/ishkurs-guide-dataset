text=Casiocore. As in...the music of actual 80s Casio keyboards. This may be a growing movement along with Synthtron and Nu Electro and VGM and the more playful side of IDM (and by that I mean the side that doesn't have its fist firmly implanted in its own ass) to inject cheesy, lo-fi electronic twerps in music or maybe even loop them and fuse them with instruments, as some punk/rock bands have been known to do. But I take a more pure stance on things: Casiocore can only be the music produced with tacky 80s keyboards alone--that is, not through any human manipulation. Just push 'samba' on that thing and away you go. Woo.
