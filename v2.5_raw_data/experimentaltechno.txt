text=And then eventually someone comes across the not-so-brilliant realization that if you pretty much loop anything, like a car door slamming or a dog barking (these are actual tracks), it becomes music. Well, duh. But then why go on to say that you are embarking on something progressive and forward-thinking simply because no one else on the planet sees the inherent musicality in scratching tree bark or distorted club soda fizz. And while I commend those willing to noodle around with all sorts of soundscapes and sonic textures, Experimental Techno is really a hit-n-miss genre. Mostly it's miss. Like peeing into a test tube. Every track that has a stroke of brilliance hardly makes up for the hours and hours of sludge that these producers churn out on a daily basis.
