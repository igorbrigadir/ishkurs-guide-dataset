text=Nothing was more coveted for 8-11 year old males than getting a copy of 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty As They Wanna Be" back in 1989. I should know, for I was one of them. All the controversy, all the censorship, all the obscenity cases and conservative backlash produced the exact opposite effect in all prepubescent youngsters. We saw the album for what it really was: stupid, silly, dumb, full of filthy language and toilet humour, and deliberately pushing the buttons of grownups. It wasn't until years later that the full influence of the album hit home: dirty down south booty bass music, taking the panhandle by storm and ignoring the east coast/west coast dichotomy in rap music, was party music through and through. The gang vocals, the raunchy choruses, and the deep, throbbing bass--the turing test for any phat ride's bumpin' subs--is wholly and completely unignorable. And the best part is Dirty South Rap music has recently seen a resurgence in the music known as Crunk, and it's all thanks to Lil Jon, and by Lil Jon I mean Dave Chappelle.
