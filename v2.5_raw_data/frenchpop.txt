text=Every genre in this circle here has one legendary track. For Electronic Psychedelia it was The Beatles - Tomorrow Never Knows. For Classical Electronic it was the Dr. Who theme. For Early Synth it was Hot Butter - Popcorn. And this, here, the early French Pop scene, was pretty much single-handedly invented in 1968 by one guy: Jean-Jacques Perrey, with the release of E.V.A., advanced the cause of stupid, plinky-plonky electronic music, but with more of an artist/band slant (though it was called French Pop, not all of them were French. There were Belgians too). It came into its own around about the same time the Italians discovered the genius of the galloping, arpeggiated synth, which kind of steamrolled French Pop into obscurity. But it did produce the most unintentionally awful cult movie of all time: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, and a whole wack of synthed-up Beatles covers. Oh man oh man oh man, was that ever awful, and by awful I mean awesome.
