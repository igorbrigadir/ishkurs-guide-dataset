text=If the naysayers have been complaining a lot that electronic music just sounds like a cd skipping over and over again, you can now show them this genre as verifiable proof that YES--indeed, that is what the music is doing. clicks, cuts, scratchy, sped-up samples, and everything but the kitchen sink. This is sound collage music, put together with all the skill and ingenuity of a 5 year old finger painting. And Glitchcore rules for that stupid fact alone.
