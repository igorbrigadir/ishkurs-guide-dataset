text=The infamous drum machine responsible for techno, electro, and the entire decade of 80s music sounding all tinny and raspy. The problem with the 808 is that it doesn't sound anywhere close to real drums (was it trying to?). It doesn't have a bassdrum--that sound you hear is just bass, something so deep it makes the cat run around the house in utter confusion. And what the hell is that ticky noise? Is that electronic twerp supposed to be a cowbell? Christopher Walken would not approve. These don't sound anything like.....well, like anything. Yet somehow, this machine released soulless, mechanical hell upon an unsuspecting music industry and, much like all the other equipment detailed on here, was rediscovered well after the company discontinued making them by an electronic arm of musicians who consider those quirky noises happy accidents.
