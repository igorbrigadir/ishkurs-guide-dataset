text=More of a description than a genre, per se. Techno tastes are more territorial than aesthetic (unlike the other genres) so there's a hell of a lot more bleeding and immense crossover work by labels, artists and styles than there are anywhere else. A minimal subgenre of this has been spawned called Hard Minimal Shit. There are pretty much "minimal" versions of every subgenre of techno, and there are even minimal versions of every techno artist (example: Richie Hawtin/Plastikman). It's something of a law, I think.
