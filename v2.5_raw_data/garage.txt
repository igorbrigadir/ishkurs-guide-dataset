text=Around the same time that gay black people were inventing House in Chicago, gay black people were inventing Garage in New York. It makes you wonder if gay black people in other cities weren't doing similar things, like maybe 'Shack' in Indianapolis, or 'Toolshed' in Des Moines, or the uptempo, swanky, soulful 'Apartment Complex' coming out of Cleveland's urban underground. Where House brings the funk, Garage brings the soul, as it sounds more organic and 'disco-y'. Scientists have still yet been able to figure out what makes its spin-off genres 2-step/UK and that godawful 'speed' stuff actual Garage, since they've both been disowned from conception.
