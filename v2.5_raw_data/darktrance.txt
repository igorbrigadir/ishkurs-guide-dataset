text=Trance crackers might be aghast at the thought that a blissful genre like trance could actually be.....*gulp*.....DARK....but in truth dark, evil-sounding trance was around before all the flighty, angelic crud. Trance, in its very basic form, is very cold and unfeeling stuff. Staccato synthlines, twitchy pulses, the subservience to technology. It's no wonder the underground rivetheads picked up and understood this sound before the mainstream maaaah-sive club patrons did.
