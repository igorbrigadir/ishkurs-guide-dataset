text=This has been around for years, and has its roots way back in the 70s, with dancehall reggae, dub, and other things coming from those kooky Jamaicans. Doubling the speed of the record and MCing on top of it gave rise to the world's first rastafarian electronic sound. Gotta love them crazy-ass snare rolls and barely comprehensible caribbean dialects. But please, if you're a white MC, unless your name is Snow, do not try to inundate your rhymes with an annoying faux-rasta chatta. You sound like a god damn retard when you do that. Anyways, this music gave the genre its namesake, as by some accounts it picked it up from a ghetto in Kingston, Jamaica called 'The Concrete Jungle.'
