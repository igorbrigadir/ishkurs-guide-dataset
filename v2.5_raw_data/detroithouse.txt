text=The Detroit guys weren't completely oblivious to what was going on around them in New York and Chicago at the time. In fact, on many occasions, they (well, okay, it was really just Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson) tried to recreate the bumpin', soulful house grooves of their sister cities, but their tracks still came out sounding kind of sinister and mechanical. Not warm and friendly like house, but cold and impersonal......like techno! This early movement was classified as Detroit's House sound (hence: Detroit House), but it's really proto tech-house. In much the same way that dinosaurs are proto-birds. In other words: extinct long ago, and still much more interesting than anything current.
