text=Raves weren't actual raves until this came along. 1988, the Summer of Love, the Hacienda, Shoom, Heaven, and all that. Well, first they were called acid house parties, then they were raves. The music itself is actually pretty moody and sinister compared to today. We always think of the music at parties to be upbeat and energizing. I think the whole motif of this evil-sounding, mechanical 80s music in dark rooms with minimal lighting and hundreds of people squashed on drugs swaying about like automatons to be quaintly cool. Of course, at the time this must have freaked out the suits. It would've freaked me out too. It's definitely lost its edge since those seedy days. Rave-oriented music now is just too warm, receptive, and pleasant-sounding to give its origins any justice.
