text=As history would have it, Ambient House is pretty much synonymous with the early 90s Ambient revitalization of Ambient stuff pioneered in the 70s by Eno and company and pussified into New Age and ethnic world music in the 80s, but I'm going to take a more literal route (as I am with everything else on here): it's Ambient with a House beat. The artists and tracks might often be confused for Ambient Trance or Ambient Techno, but they're not. No, I won't explain what the difference is. If this is the last genre you've come to and you can't figure it out for yourself by now, I'm through explaining this stupid electronic music shit to you. Go bug a local DJ about it instead. It's not like anyone else is really going to care at this point.
