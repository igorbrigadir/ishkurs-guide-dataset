text=You see, in 1988 there was all this lovey dovey acid house shit going on, and even though the music was not as flamboyant and upbeat as it is today, it still wasn't sinister and mean enough for some people, so they took to perverting it with an industrial edge, making it harder, nastier, and also very kinky and provocative, and that fit in just right with the new "rave" movement kicking things into high gear in 1989. Legend purports that this music emerged when some DJ accidently played an acid house record at 33 RPM (not 45, its intended speed). This slowed things really down, to like 100 BPM, and it made the music really sinister and drolling. The trend caught on, and soon producers were making up for its ultra-slow house groove by making the beat harder, fuller, and louder, like a clanging hammer on an anvil. This is one of the greater ironies about Hardcore: that at it's origin it was actually the slowest dance music in existence.
