text=Now this one is odd. It's hard, but at the same time it's not hard. Summarily put, Hard Trance is yet another refuge for fleeing souls of the Anthem comedown at the turn of the millenium. The funny thing is it has actually picked up "hard" anthems since then, so the new arrivees won't feel at all estranged by this --intense-- music. Personally, I think if you have to abandon flighty emotional stuff for a harder edge in order to get people to take you seriously as a musician, you probably aren't a very good one. This music will probably be made by mad-libs computer programs a generation from now (if it isn't already).
