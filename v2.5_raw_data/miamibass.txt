text=Every few years, like clockwork, a Miami Bass track will come out of nowhere and get REALLY big on the Top40 charts. It happened with Tag Team's "Whoomp there it is". It happened with 69 Boyz' "Tootsee Roll". And it happened (unfortunately) again with Baha Men's "Who Let the Dogs Out." For such a fun genre, I'm still trying to figure out why this happens with only a select few songs, and not all of them. Like, for instance, why did Tag Team's "Whoomp! There it is" make it big and not 95 South's "Woot! There it is", when they are practically the same song? Well, no matter. Because when it comes to happy, fun music, this is the best bass there is. (oh, and don't worry: I didn't use Baha Men as a sample here. I'm not THAT cruel)
