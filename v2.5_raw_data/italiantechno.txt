text=Of course, the Italians want to take a stab at it too. But due to their huge Housey heritage and they being second only to the Swedes in churning out legendarily cheesy pop hits (but the Swedes are excused, because they can do anything, even fly. That's why their brand of techno is better), their attempts at the machine pulses and rhythms actually just made it come out sounding a lot like Tech House. Capital try, though!
