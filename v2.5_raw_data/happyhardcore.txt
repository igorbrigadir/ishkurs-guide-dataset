text=Happy Hardcore is like the spoiled little sibling of the Hardcore family, who got all the breaks, all the looks, all the money, all the chicks and all the successes of life without having to work for it. Just about despised by every other genre, Happy Hardcore is the most popular Hardcore music of all, with its signature chipmunk vocals and silly sing-a-long anthems and shameless hug-a-thon optimism that pisses everybody off to no end. This is the core realm of the candy ravers. Some of the stuff feels so godawfully childish that I feel like a pedophile just listening to it, but its not all bad. Truth be known: ALL the world's Happy Hardcore is made by only 12 guys, who have more pseudonyms than a shark has teeth, and who churn it out at such a feverish pace you'd almost think that there's probably a program that makes it for them. Just randomize the key values, get Sugar from YTV to sing the lyrics, and away you go.
