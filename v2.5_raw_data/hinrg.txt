text=I'm completely confused as to what this is or was or is trying to be. Part Italo Disco, part Synthpop, part EBM, part Electro Boogie, all 80s. And any one of the artists or labels or songs here could easily be classified under the others. So this is like the jumping off point for other things. The signifying feature seems to be that it's like any ordinary 80s pop-dance, only heavy on those buzzing, spitting synths that have since become the ubiquetous trademark feature of this whole genre (no, not the anthems, dumbass). I guess you could call it proto-trance. In much the same way that a cow is proto-food.
