text=Ahh, Big Beat. This is the genre that finally made the homophobic frat house crowd finally accept that pussy electronic music at their Saturday night kegger parties. I mean, they still thought it was gay, but not as gay as that faggot trance shit. Its curious nickname, Amyl House, is apparently a localized term in the music's origin (England) named after the tendancy for youths to dance to the stuff while huffing amyl-nitrate. Poppers. Paint thinner. Leather polish. Yeah, sounds just like something frats would do, too. This was the spearpoint genre of the "electronica" wave of music, and when it took a nosedive, so did this. Although that Overseer track kicks ass. It makes me think of......huge hulking machines tearing helpless humans to pieces in the final battle for the fate of the world.
