text=It must've been an odd thing to see at the time: a whole class of affluent, middle class black youths from the suburbs of Detroit (Belleville, to be specific) weaning themselves on the style and culture of really obscure, androgynous, whitebread European electro pop and Italo Disco. And then they started making it themselves, surrounding it with the bleakness of their automotive surroundings. How the hell did that happen? Who knows, but we're eternally grateful it did. Classic Techno started off sounding like Electro, so don't be ashamed if you can't tell the difference. It took awhile for it to finally gain its own identity, which ironically became more important in the mainstream than anything else. May, Atkins and Saunderson are responsible for why you are looking at this guide right now.
