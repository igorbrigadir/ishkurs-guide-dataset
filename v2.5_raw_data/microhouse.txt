text=Tech House artists decided to expand their sound into ever more monotonous soundscapes when they decided to create Microhouse: A minimal version of itself not unlike Minimal Techno......only housey. It actually floundered for a few years, narrowly escaping a bitter lawsuit with a software company from Seattle, but lately it's been getting a lot of interesting press more or less because the Glitch guys (like Akufen and Matthew Dear) stumbled upon it and began applying it's sparse aesthete to their clicks and cuts. It now doesn't sound half-bad. When it's sounding like anything at all. Why is it called Microhouse? Because it really IS Micro! The kickdrums, the snares, the hi-hats all sound really compacted and tiny-like, unlike the big booming bassdrums of its brethren genres.
