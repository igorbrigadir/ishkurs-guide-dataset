text=This is about the first genre that tried to make sense of all the spastic breakbeat stuff that suddenly exploded in the early 90s. Starting off as an immediate reaction to the silly, childish sounds of Oldskool Rave Hardcore, it eventually became the template--with that oh so yummy deep, evil kick--that would spawn all latter ventures into Jungle and Drum n Bass. If there was any such thing as a category called "Classic Jungle" (like the house, trance and techno genres have), this would be it here. The true, most pure, exemplary form of the genre. Respect.
