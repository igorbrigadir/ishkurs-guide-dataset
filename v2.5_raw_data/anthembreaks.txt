text=For the most part, this is really just Anthem Trance remixed with breakbeats by breakbeat producers. That's different than Breaktrance, which is Anthem Trance producers making breakbeats that sound trancey. Understand? Neither do I. Still, this is the genre people will get into when they've gotten to the point where they feel they are much too mature and sophisticated to be listening to that childish, cheesy trance music with all the 16 year old, glowstick-wielding poptarts anymore. Well, either this or Jump Up jungle.
