text=House is the most soulful genre. It's also the simplest, the oldest, the warmest, and where electronic music is concerned, easily the most human-sounding, making it the most popular, commanding the most producers, artists, labels, DJs, fans, and subgenres. The whole of top40 pop music gets its hooks, gimmicks, lines and melodies from house music (and vice versa). That is why it stands as the world's perennial party music, and it will probably stay that way until the end of time. Or until someone finds a more catchy beat than the 4/4 bassdrum.
