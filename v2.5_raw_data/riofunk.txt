text=The infamous Rio Funk Ball music, which kind of sounds a lot like Miami Bass, only with Portuguese yelling and raps. The street ghettos of Rio de Janeiro are the setting of this fucked up movement in which impoverished youths beat each other to a bloody pulp while listening to this music in insane pseudo-rave type gatherings (Funk Balls) that behave more like anarchic Fight Clubs than plurry love-ins. Girls gouge out each other's eye sockets with high heels. Guys gang up and pulverize the weak. Deaths are not uncommon. Man....and I thought I was hardcore for hurling rotting meat at people at one party.
