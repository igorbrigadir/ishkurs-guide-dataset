text=It seems to be a domain largely of "progressive" (read: Brit House) producers who don't want to be too pretentious. More characteristically, though, it seems the whole of western popular music itself has turned very passionate (which is to say, tragic and somber), moody, abrasive and short-fused in the wake of the terrorist attacks, not just electronic music. Even a happy-go-lucky genre like house couldn't help but feel somewhat sinister and serious for awhile. That's where this music comes from. Even if the concept of "dark house" is like a water-repellent sponge.
