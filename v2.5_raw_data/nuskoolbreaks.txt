text=Like other genres mentioned in this guide, this is what happens to a genre when the British get ahold of it. Now, what the hell is this trying to be, exactly? It's like a genre that can't seem to make up its mind on what to sound like. Is it just reproduced Miami Bass? Is it just Jungle slowed down? Or is it just trying too hard to sound different? Whatever it is, it's not "nu". It's been around for quite awhile now. At least NRG got its act together and changed its name. And I'm sure there's probably like 4 or 5 sub-sub-genres (one variant undoubtedly being "progressive"....scene snobs love that word) that have come out now, but when the source is this vapid and uninteresting, who cares what they sound like.
