text=In the electronic music industry, much like every other industry, success never goes to the inventor, but to the exploiter of the invention. Illbient was coined by DJ Olive, who just happens to be a laidback, low-profile, soft-spoken kind of guy, and that does no good in a world where marketers like to take credit for everything. So big, boisterous DJ Spooky pushed him aside and claimed the genre for himself instead. The rest is infamous and pretentious history. The Turntablists like this one a lot....for when the beats just aren't slow enough, they want to bring them down to a crawl. Or a slither. Like a snail across a desert. Or like a music guide maker searching for a clumsy metaphor. Why? Because it's ILL, y0! Jesus, what a stupid word. Who comes up with slang these days, anyway? How did "sick", "bad" and "ill" become compliments? Before long, street kids will be going up to one another: "man, you are a fucking asshole!" "hey, thanx dood."
