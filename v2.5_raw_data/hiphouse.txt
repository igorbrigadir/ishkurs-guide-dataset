text=It's more popular than you think; people are just wack bitches and don't give it their props like they should. Some of your favourite top40 hits you remember getting down to at your Bar Mitzvah or Prom or Commencement or whatever lame dance you thought was cool back in highschool were actually house remixes of rap songs, or rap remixes of house songs, or a forethought meshing of both. Making them Hip House. Come to think of it, most modern rap (Dr. Dre comes to mind) is employing a steady house beat these days. I don't hear much scratching in rap music much anymore. Is hip hop truly dead?
