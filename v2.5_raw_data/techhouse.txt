text=You'd think that a hybrid genre combining the best qualities of House and Techno would be totally rad, but it's not. In actual fact, Tech House comes out mostly as a dull, monotonous drone (something Tech House was the undisputed king of until only recently, when the technique of making boring music was surpassed by the pretentious Brit House scene calling itself only "progressive"), with barely enough going for it to make it interesting. It's like it decided to combine the worst qualities of Techno and House. Why the hell it would do that, I don't know. But it's been around, like, forever, and people keep making it, so someone somewhere has to be listening/buying/dancing/spinning all those Tech House records. I have yet to find anyone though (Tripwire, shut up).
