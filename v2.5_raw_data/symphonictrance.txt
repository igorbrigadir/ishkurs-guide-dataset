text=I can't decide if this is trance with orchestrations behind it, or swelling orchestral scores that include a drum machine (or some kind of trancey rhythm section), or trance that samples orchestral strings, or maybe it's just another stupid name in Epic Trance's nitpickingly long list of accolades. I know what it is NOT, though: crappy remixes of film and classical pieces (yeah, I'm looking at you DJ Sakin, Cygnus X and William Orbit, you turds). However much of it is out there, I can't tell. But I'll put it up when I find some worthy enough to be called "symphonic".
