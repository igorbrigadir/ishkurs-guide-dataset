text=In the mid-90s, House was in a major funk. And by funk I mean it wasn't doing too well. Yeah, the primo dance music of the world was struggling with what to do next. Nothing was inspiring, records were weak, a real lull was apparent. And then along come these pretentious Parisian students (oh, but aren't they all pretentious? It is the French, after all. Saying they're pretentious is like saying fat people are overweight). Anyways, along come these French students, who took house music out of its funk by putting it back into the FUNK! I mean it: they literally turned the entire fucking industry on its ear overnight with their special brand of 70s/80s electro porn music house. Stuff so filtered, so funky, and so fresh, they just had to call it French. If anything of value has ever come from France, it's this music right here. At this point, you can't NOT deny the genius that is Thomas Bangalter. He is the only reason why the world does not sack France.
