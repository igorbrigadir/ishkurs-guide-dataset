text=North American music has always had a more serious, distinctive, harder edge than European music. I think this is due mainly to immigration and the fact that American culture is 'manufactured', so it constantly has to justify itself through a sort of machismo self-assertion, as opposed to other cultures which evolved naturally and fluently through history. Like comparing American football with European football: one side that favours skill and agility versus one side that favours raw, brute force. A good sociological paper can be written exploring this phenomenon, but here is not the time for that. So while European Hardcore always likes to grace the silly side of hoover cheesyness, American Hardcore never wants to be thought of as unmanly. But I think the harder it tries, the stupider it sounds.
