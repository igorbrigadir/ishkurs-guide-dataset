text=Actually, as timelines would have it, there is (sigh). In the third century BC, Ktesibios, a Greek engineer, studied pneumatics and hydraulics and managed to come up with a water-controlled organ that he called the Hydraulis. Using an intricate system of levers, switches, and sacrificing the first-born to the Gods of Olympus, the Hydraulis was the first device that enabled someone to play more than one instrument at the same time.
The Greeks also invented the Aeolian harp, which was the first automatic instrument that played music without needing human input. I suppose they could have also invented sequencers and trackers to get the thing to play what they wanted, but they didn't need to. They simply set the strings at a prescribed pitch and let the wind blow through them, creating music. Essentially, the thing was a nothing more than a dressed-up, fancy, multi-tonal whistle. Big fucking deal, guys. 
Anyways, the Hydraulos was really keen for its day, because it allowed for harmonic complexity and fullness of sound. What makes it electronic music, you might ask? Well....they used water. And water, as we all know, is a deadly absorber of electricity, so it all makes sense in the end. Organs were ultimately the first synthesizers anyway. That's why all modern synths have a keyboard as their native control panel, and not, like....a series of strings or bagpipes or something. Though electronic bagpipes would be pretty keen.
So. That's it. The origin of electronic music. Over 2000 years ago. Amazing how far we've come.
