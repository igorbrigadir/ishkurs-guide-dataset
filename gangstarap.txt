text=East coast rappers took note of the west coast's anger and fury (and obviously the south's style of production and adult-oriented direction), and so became thugs themselves. Since that is what sells records and continues to sell records, Gangsta Rap pretty much dominates the commercial rap landscape today, on the strength of Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Records label. But the issue isn't really who is more hardcore than who, or who is more misogynistic or more foul-mouthed or more OGT........it's really all about who has the most money. See, the only real objective standard of comparison that a rapper can count on is his popularity. Popularity means record sales, and record sales mean humongous profits. Thus, it stands to reason that the wealthiest rappers must be the best. So with both sides pushing each other, visible signs of frivolous wealth has become the benchmark of a rapper's rapping ability. That's where bling bling, worthless materialism, and idiotic and arcane demands made of employees and inferiors (aka Queen Bitch or Diva-ism) come from. It's a oneupsmanship thing, the black equivalent of keeping up with the Joneses.
