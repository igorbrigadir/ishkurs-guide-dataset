text=It's basically gabber, but with those off-beat circus-like Happy Hardcore stabs. Or it's gabber with really silly and awful lyrics (which shouldn't be confused as the cutesy girl sing-a-long Happy Hardcore lyrics) or samples and quotes that are really really really.......dumb. So I guess like Happy Hardcore, only not so happy. It's more like stupid. But fun! And cheesy, but not as cheesy as Gabber House. Ummmmm....yeah. It's the MOR of Hardcore genres.
