text=Wallpaper music. Background music. Mood music. Music for airports, department stores and elevators (but not elevator music). Probably invented by a whole bunch of guys (but mostly Brian Eno) ripping off the spacey, ethereal Pink Floyd-like psychedelic art-rock bands of the late 60s and the academic snobs of Minimalism. Resurrected by The KLF in the 90s, where it became a staple of every chill room's soothing environment (yes, it should by AMBIENT, you dickheads. Not house records at 33). This is likely the music you'll be listening to when you die. A stark contrast, since it's probably heavy metal you were listening to when you were born. Wouldn't life be much cooler if it were the other way around? (note: Ambient is impossible to loop, so don't complain to me if it doesn't align right)
