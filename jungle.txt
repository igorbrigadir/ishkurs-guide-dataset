text=Jungle is the sole aggressor of the genres. It is also the only genre that might lay claim to having been invented solely in the 90s, even though it's not. The antithesis to the bright, flashy schmaltz that some of the other genres exhibit, the black sheep of the electronic family is rough, abrasive, crusty, dirty, and full of swaggering machismo. Even its namesake speaks of raw, primitive militarism, lending fashion and behavior tips to its aficionados. The cleaner variant of Jungle, Drum n Bass, a term invented by the music press before there was a sound to signify it (one of the few genres where the actual name predated the existence of the music), is very formulaic, clean and smoothed out, and hence trendy to those who like to be junglists but the cut-up sounds of jungle just aren't palatable to them.
