# Eurotrash


## Dancepunk
*aka:  Dance-punk, Discopunk, New Rave, Punk Funk, Electropunk* in the Eurotrash scene, emerged in early 00s

Dancepunk or Discopunk is the cousin to Indie -- punk bands with synthesizers. Or it's what happens when you take Electroclash and remove the Electro. You would think that it would revert back to just plain Synthpop and in some cases it did, but true to its name Dancepunk likes to keep the "punk" even though its audience is mostly hipsters.
Its alternative name, Discopunk, has its origins in late 70s Britain to refer to Punk bands that went Disco (a heresy in some circles) but not New Wave (it's complicated... think of an upbeat Joy Division). It doesn't actually have anything to do with modern Dancepunk but the names are interchangeable so evidently some UK music writers think there is a correlation. There isn't.
If you hate electronic music, Dancepunk is probably the only electronic genre you may somewhat tolerate. While a number of famous bands (Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, hell even Gorillaz) have been considered Dancepunk at one time or another, the band that really put the "dance" in Dancepunk was LCD Soundsystem with their hit track that confused everyone into thinking Dancepunk was a club and rave thing: Daft Punk Is Playing At My House (a-my house-ah). In a classic case of false advertising, the song doesn't have anything resembling Daft Punk in it.
(wouldn't be the first time that happened. For instance, there's Panic! At The Disco, a band that plays music that is neither Disco nor high-anxiety inducing)
LCD Soundsystem and their label Death From Above aggressively foisted this sound upon an unsuspecting club culture and the genre was picked up by other bands who recognized that live music was on the outs, guitars were déclassé, and a steady beat was necessary if you wanted the DJ to drop your record in the club.
Like any Punk, Punk-derived, Punk-inspired or Punk-spawned form of music, Dancepunk is irresistably drawn toward selling out. It was the first Millenial genre to spread best via commercial advertising -- mostly car companies, telcoms, tech coms, or any other corporation that tries too hard to appeal to young urban trendsetters by being totally with it and down with the scene, man.

Apple is a shady, manipulative, walled-garden cesspool of Fisher Price filth that caters to insufferable morons too busy, lazy or stupid to properly use technology, and iTunes is a horrendously bloated piece of shit spyware DRM RIAA crime racket masquerading as a useful music service.

	(Ting Tings - Shup Up And Let Me Go)
	

This is the bottom of the Guide. If you're one of those obsessive-compulsive completist types who has to go through everything sequentially and this is the last genre you're visiting -- like you just have to read every page in a Choose Your Own Adventure book in numerical order -- that's probably not the best use of your time. Have you considered crystal meth?
Ish.


## Filthy Electrohouse
*aka:  Electrohouse* in the Eurotrash scene, emerged in early 00s

Filthy Electrohouse can probably be interchangeable with Electrohouse. But it's not.
Because Electrohouse came from French House whereas Filthy Electrohouse came from Electroclash (even though both came from the French... quite possibly the same French guys). It's really just Electroclash with a House kick. And because it came from Electroclash it was somewhat fronted by bands.

Or in the case of Justice: Fake bands.
	

Benny Benassi basically started this one with Satisfaction, one of those obnoxious smash hits with an annoying anthem that nevertheless finds favor with the offensively lame. It's the one you hear in sports arenas alongside The Launch, Kernkraft 400, and Sandstorm.
But the real culprits for pushing this sound were aforementioned Justice and Ed Banger Records, who gave the world such tired sonic cliches (though not at the time) as crunchy bitcrushed clutch glitch cuts, which was later co-opted by Dubstep producers who correctly ascertained that chronic anal fissures was going to be the next big thing.
But the real difference between the two is the sleaze. Filthy Electrohouse is simply filthier. It has more grimy hooks and leads, pornographic lyrics and treated overdriven vocals, scratchier acid and noisier glitch cuts. Filthy Electrohouse is the Metal to Electrohouse's Hard Rock. Or it is what Electrohouse would want to be if it did not care about commercial appeal.
That's not to say that there wasn't plenty of cross-polination or commercial smash hits in Filthy Electrohouse. It's not like there were DJs who would play only Filthy Electrohouse and not regular Electrohouse. This demarcation is my invention only -- it didn't exist at the time. Everyone called everything Electro in the 00s which was, to quote Wolfgang Pauli, not even wrong.
But it's important to make the distinction because where Electrohouse was very much a producer & DJ dominated genre, and hence fit more in the House pantheon, Filthy Electrohouse takes from its Electroclash parents in that it is largely fronted by bands. That play live, on stage with, like, instruments. Eurotrash and Industrial/Goth are pretty much the only two scenes that do this.

There is some Filthy Electrohouse in this.
	

Filthy Electrohouse is probably still around today although sometime in the 2010s it got subsumed into the common electronic world of DJ-oriented delivery and its bands moved on to find the next big thing to pillage. It is still too recent to sound dated, but ten years from now this will be one of those genres that people will say was a product of its time, like platform shoes or cars with tailfins.
Ish.


## Electroclash
*aka:  Synthpunk, Nu Synthpop* in the Eurotrash scene, emerged in late 90s

Electroclash is the answer to the question: What if riot grrrls picked up synthesizers and sequencers and detuned them just as much as their guitars?
Probably something similar to Grunge. Not in the music revolution sense but more like the sleazy skid row heroin overdose sense.
Electroclash was one of those darling pet genres of the late 90s and early 2000s that self-important hyperbolical magazine writers constantly crooned over with gasping praise. It seemed to accumulate more names than actual artists or labels because music writers love to pretend that they invented something by naming it.
In the first few years of existence Electroclash was known as Glitchcore, Nu Synthpop, Eurotrash, Synthcore, Glitz, Electropop, Robotrash, Synthpunk, Futurepunk -- hell, I called it Synthtron at the time because if Mixmag can make up names of genres so can I. Also: I was a huge Ladytron fan.
To be a proper Electroclash band you have to never smile. In fact, just look like you're bored that you're in a band. Or that you're unsure which gender you are.
After the dust settled and music journalists went back to their "Every Springsteen Song Ranked Best to Worst" clickbait exposes, the name everyone settled on was Electroclash, coined in 2001 by club promoter Larry Tee and his traveling freakshow festival (ie: Peaches and Fischerspooner).
New electronic music genres usually never get much attention from the mainstream music press but Electroclash caught their eye because while it was fully electronic, it was more inspired by Punk and Glam Rock, with full bands and colorful stage shows, and that's something that catches the eye of the music press a lot: The performance rather than the music.
Despite the name, Electroclash does not have a lot to do with Electro, except maybe initially because no one was sure what to call I-F - Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass. I suppose you could call it Electro, but it focused more on heavy droning synths than the robotic percussion endemic to real Electro. I mean, how are you supposed to breakdance to it?
The genre would get a not-very-much-needed shot in the arm when second generation Chicago House maven Felix Da Housecat came out with this:
Kittenz And Thee Glitz. Because everyone loves fusion genres.
Electroclash was more sleazy than sexual, more filthy and grimy than sleek and polished, with pornographic lyrics and dour commentary on media, fashion modelling, and fame (Lady Gaga's special brand of Glam Punk was basically Electroclash fused with Synthpop).

Electroclash brought to the world metrosexuality (though it did not coin it -- that was fashion/marketing bullshittery), omnisexuality, sexual objectification of the decrepit, and a surly, anti-commercial fuck-you attitude that could only come from Punk.
True to its Punk roots, most of the bands who made Electroclash hated the term and refused to have anything to do with it (especially the ones who were making it before it was coined a thing).
Genrefication is for self-important music writers, after all. Not musicians. Labels are useful as a general guide of what to look for but they should never be used to pigeonhole any specific sound with any degree of absolute certainty. I say this with both sincerity and irony.
Electroclash was the opening gambit of the renewed emphasis on "electro" music in the 00s which was not really Electro but it sounded 80s and no one wanted to admit that they were listening to Synthpop again. It is still around today in a vestigial form, but by and large Electroclash waned in the late 00s when it merged with House music to become its dancier and thus more popular counterpart: Filthy Electrohouse.
Ish.

# Eurodisco

## Hi NRG
*aka:  Hi-NRG, HINRG, Electro Boogie* in the Eurodisco scene, emerged in late 70s

Hi NRG (or Hi-NRG or HINRG or Hello, Energy) was an offshoot of Disco made possible only in that rare period where limitation in analog synthesizers could produce novel musical ideas.
Synthesizers had been used in Disco and Funk music for awhile but mostly as rhythm components or atmospherics to accompany the walking basslines, horn fanfares, emotional strings, and other Disco cliches.
So while a number of electronic-infused Disco tracks predated it, the first fully electronic Disco song was the 1977 monster hit Donna Summer - I Feel Love, under the genius of dance music godfather Giorgio Moroder (a name and career you absolutely have to memorize if you want to bullshit your way through an electronic music conversation at a dinner party).
And by fully electronic, I mean everything: The percussion, the bassline, the pads -- all sculpted with expert precision on a Moog Modular (the kickdrum, however, didn't come out quite right so they used a real drummer). The bassline was meant to be a typical off-beat bass stab except the Moog was monophonic so it couldn't play chords. Moroder found a way around this through arpeggiation, so it was a design limitation that created one of the most addictive sounds in electronic music: The galloping bassline.
Analog synthesizers were notorious for their tendency to drift off key over time. There was no sequencing in those days so to keep the pattern consistent Moroder had to record the signature bassline eight bars at a time, a tedious Harryhausen-like process that paid off as a million dance records owe their allegience to this one flaw technique. What took him hours of painstaking precision to do, you can do today in your DAW of choice in a few seconds.
Almost instantly everyone copied Moroder's style and within a year the Disco scene was flooded with these bare-bones tracks with the Moroder bassline. At the time it was still called Disco or Electro Boogie to separate it from the strings & horns side of cheesy commercial Disco. But the name Hi NRG took over when Donna Summer was asked why her track was so popular and she responded that it had a "high energy vibe".
Hi NRG remained throughout the 80s as an unmistakeable facet of gay club culture, a genre for the divas, disco sluts, drag queens, transvestites, tops and bottoms alike feeding each other horny drugs.
While regular disco solidifed into female-driven pop stars (see: Madonna, Cher), Hi NRG continued the great Barry Gibb tradition of male vocalists singing in falsetto. This was Disco for the underground gay scene, which purportedly hates it when the mainstream co-opts its sounds so it always tries to stay 5-10 years in front of the trends.
(Hi NRG, incidentally, can also claim the gayest song of all time, a San Francisco-tinged cover/parody of Zappa's Valley Girl)
Don't fuck with Divine.
Disco in the States cratered in the 80s but Hi NRG kept going thanks to immortal icons like Divine, Larry Levan, Sylvester, and Patrick Cowley, none of whom are with us today (seriously, Fuck AIDS).
That's not to say every important Hi NRG artist kicked the bucket because picking up the slack was Bobby Orlando, a prolific studio rat who kept the vibe going through his gargantuan list of aliases, impeccable work ethic, and shameless willingness to rip off himself.
And then there was Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Fucking Stock, Aitken & Waterman who brought Hi NRG to the masses with their assembly line approach to pop music saturation, in one case creating over a hundred pop hits with the same god damn beat.

digidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigidigi


Hi NRG is a relic of an era where synths can only do so much. It is remarkable that it lasted as long as it did, well past the point when more superior synths hit the market that could compensate for the shortcomings endemic to Hi NRG. But it wasn't destined to last past the 80s.
Hi NRG informed Italo Disco, Synthpop, and a lot of hit music in the 80s, and its legacy lives on in successor genres that worship at the alter of the galloping synth, including Eurodance, EBM, and yes: Trance.
Ish.


## Synthpop
*aka:  New Wave, Dancepop, Electropop, Glam Pop* in the Eurodisco scene, emerged in late 70s

Synthpop started out as a non-Synthpop genre. At least in England.
It was more directly influenced by New Wave (aka Punk with synthesizers), which was synonymous with Synthpop in the early going.
Synthpop was probably spearheaded by The Human League who liked to consider themselves the originators of the genre, but while they were busting their ass trying to make their sound a thing they were beaten to the Top of the Pops by Gary Numan, in much the same way Elisha Gray was beaten to the patent office by Alexander Graham Bell as the inventor of the telephone. That's the way Brit music writers like to portray it.
But while the British did dominate the sound throughout the 80s, I like to think that the origins of Synthpop have more of an international influence than the Brits feel comfortable admitting, from the German Krautrockers to the Italo Moroderists to the quirky French Pop avant-gardists like Jean Jacques Perrey, Telex, and Jacno. Speaking of whom: Here's a Belgian girl dancing in her panties.

 Lio - Amoureux Solitaires, with that addictively minimalist Jacno production gloss.Before you complain, this was her idea.
	

Unlike other genres in the Eurodisco scene, Synthpop doesn't have a specific core sound or template, except to say that it's Hi NRG without the gay or Italo Disco without the Italo.
Throughout its history the term Synthpop has been used to refer to any and all synth-driven rock music from Indie Pop to Discopunk (and maybe even Eurodance). The David Bowie wannabes in the New Romantic movement and the charting conquest of androgynous boy bands in the 80s were all considered flavors of Synthpop, even the ones who didn't use synths very much.
Synthpop is probably the most successful and popular genre on this guide not called R&B. It is the music everyone associates with the 80s (that and Heavy Metal). The bands you see on every K-Tel Remember The 80s compilation -- Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, Flock of Seagulls, New Order, Visage, Ultravox, Human League, Soft Cell, Tears For Fears, Pet Shop Boys, A-Ha, Devo, The Buggles, Men Without Hats, Thompson Twins, Thomas Dolby, Berlin -- are so tiring and played out that I will leave an 80s clubnight if any of their hits are dropped. I don't even care if they're on this guide or not. Popular music is useless to me. The best Synthpop never charted anyway.
Synthpop seemingly took a hiatus in the late 80s as House took over clubland and Hip Hop took over record charts, but it returned in the late 90s in new forms that were not necessarily throwbacks. The biggest offshoot was Electroclash but in the 2000s subgenres took over including Electropop (Passion Pit, Owl City), Glam Pop (Lady Gaga, Blood on the Dancefloor, Empire of the Sun), and Synthwave (the Internet).
Synthpop is probably here to stay, if only because electronic music is here to stay and guitar bands haven't charted in decades and probably never will again. Every generation finds its own heroes to worship and the current one is not interested in their parents' stupid Vietnam music.
Ish.



## Synthwave
*aka:  Outrun, Darksynth, Retrowave, Futuresynth, Cybersynth, Dreamwave, Popwave* in the Eurodisco scene, emerged in early 00s

Synthwave is the fetishization of a 1980s that didn't really exist, where everything is neon and wireframe, you're wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers and a Member's Only jacket, and you're cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in a red Ferrari Mondial Cabriolet while Morgan Fairchild (or Heather Locklear, or Christy Brinkly, or Heather Thomas) is sitting in the passenger seat wearing a spandex bodysuit, headband, and leg warmers.
The genre is nicknamed Outrun for a reason.
Synthwave is more retrofuturist than nostalgic, like Steampunk or Wakanda. It remembers the best elements of the 80s: 8-bit video games, dystopian movies, cyberpunk literature, bad chromakey effects, and pastel-colored sports jackets, while conveniently forgetting that the 80s also had chlorofluorocarbons, acid rain, Reagonomics, AIDS, mullets and ginormous perms, rolled jeans, ninjas, overalls, killer bees, shoulder pads, Mr. T, sweatbands, Dick Clark, stirrups, fanny packs, jheri curls, and insidiously manipulative corporate brainwashing of the nation's youth into mindless consumers Saturday morning cartoons.
Synthwave is today's generation looking back with fondness at all the fun they missed in this commercial:

Wow, that's as much as 14.2 DX7s!
	

But everything wasn't all sunshine and rainbows in the 80s. Remember, this is the decade that gave us crack cocaine and Donald fucking Trump. Some of its mistakes (like huge deficits caused by tax cuts for the rich) and many of its concerns (like coming up with a post-space shuttle contingency program in case it blows up in our faces) we still haven't resolved today.
80s revivalism is not a new or recent phenomenon. Technically it has been going on for longer than the 80s did. Chromeo, Tiga, and Les Rhythmes Digitales were doing 80s music as far back as the 90s.

This came out in 1998. Seven years later the red-haired dude was making 80s music for Madonna.
	

Synthwave had some early adopters like the Electroclash/Electrohouse crossovers Bangkok Impact, Legowelt and Putsch '79, but none of their explorations really captured that idealized Jan-Hammer-meets-New-Order-meets-John-Carpenter desperate reach for the ultra-mega turbo 80s zenith sound until the French House guys started making it.
Synthwave wallowed in obscurity for a decade or so (despite producing some memorable and not so memorable hits), to such an extent that it didn't have a name yet. Everyone still called it Electro, which was wrong but that's what they called anything in the 00s that had a whiff of sounding like it came from the 80s, which was everything.
New Retro Wave -- for all your Synthwave needs!
It's only when Synthwave found its way into other media -- Movies like Drive and Turbo Kid, video games like Hotline Miami and Grand Theft Auto, Patrick Nagel-inspired cartoons like Moonbeam City, TV shows like Stranger Things, viral Youtube videos like Kung Fury, and yes that indominatable pop culture poseur Ernest fucking Cline -- that it became necessary to call it a thing that needed a new name, and since the 80s trend was to call new things "wave", Synthwave seemed to fit. It's a vision of the 80s as affected and artificial as Pleasantville's portrayal of the 50s or Japan's portrayal of Japan.

I made this in 2015. So much good Synthwave has come out since then that I might make another one.
	

As with anything popular, Synthwave has fractured into substyles, the most evocative of which is Darksynth, a slower more menacing groove (mixes well with New Beat), sometimes in downtempo breakbeats instead of 4-to-the-floor. Other subgenres that may not actually exist are Cybersynth, Dreamwave, and Popwave.
Synthwave doesn't show any signs of slowing down, as the 80s doesn't show any signs of going away. And why would it? We are still living that decade today, with the economy serving the rich and the media serving Donald fucking Trump.
Ish.


## Spacesynth
*aka:  Space Disco, Space Rock, Cosmo Rock* in the Eurodisco scene, emerged in late 70s

Spacesynth is the sufficiently more instrumental and insufficiently less gay side of Hi NRG.
A precursor of Spacesynth was Space Disco (a misnomer since it sounded less Disco than Spacesynth did), a Moog-driven atmospheric soundscape style of music that borrowed heavily from the noodly meanderings of Psychedelic/Progressive Rock and the film scores of Vangelis and Edward Artemiev (you know, the Russian Vangelis), but with a steady dance beat.
Space Disco was fully electronic before any of its sister genres were, utilizing the best in French Pop futurism, dorky avant-garde outfits, and state of the art special effects. But especially the dorkism. It's like it was answering the question: What if Joe Satriani made electronic music? It would probably sound like Spacesynth. All Spacesynth leads are just Joe Satriani guitar solos. That's not a bad thing. I mean, who cares when the music videos are this fun:

I love how totally committed that drummer is. Just look at him go.(Space - Magic Fly)
	

By the 80s Space Disco's casual experimentation codified into a cultivated edifying formula, becoming Spacesynth -- a name that probably had something to do with Laserdance, the only Spacesynth act you could consider to be a mega super star.
Key to Spacesynth are the two-note bassline arps, each an octave apart giving off an energetic, busy, bouncey, forward-thrusting kind of arp that's not a gay disco arp (arps, incidentally, is Meghan Markle's nickname for Prince Harry).
On top of the arps are pitch-bending bright synth leads, occasional vocals (usually spoken word vocoded into incoherence), and a docile production gloss and simple chord progressions that give it an inoffensive soft rock kind of feel. Spacesynth is MOR electronic music.
Spacesynth differentiated from its Italo and Hi NRG cousins by being considerably more geeky. Spacesynth artists tend to be old shut-ins in their 40s farting around with Amigas and Trackers, and since it has adopted the feel of a "dad" genre it has remained remarkably pure and resistant to change, retaining the same tropes and cliches that it established in the early 80s without much deviation in style or composition.
Next to Krautrock, Spacesynth is the genre with the most consistency. It does not care if other genres have trendwhored Electro or Dubstep or Trap. It sticks to its sound no matter what.
And that may be the one interesting thing of note about Spacesynth is that despite being a terrific four-to-the-floor dance genre, it's not known as a genre for dancing (but then again I have yet to encounter it at any parties so I wouldn't know).
Spacesynth is best known as an energetic non-threatening genre with a surprising amount of commercial applications, almost like royalty free music. You may have heard it as background music in 80s VHS boardroom presentations or educational videos, community access TV show theme songs, commercial interstitials, pornography, and Amiga/Tracker conferences. You know, the stuff dorky guys in their 40s are into.
And once again: The music videos are just wild.

Koto - Jabdah. Yeah the synth isn't plugged in but it has an I❤ZYX sticker on the back so it's okay.Also: What the hell is going on in this video?
	

Spacesynth is one of the few genres that isn't distributed through compilations or singles but through full artist albums, usually with lovely cover art by Roger Dean or Ralph McQuarrie (or some artist inspired by them).
Roger Dean = Yes/Asia. Ralph McQuarrie = Star Wars.
Today there is a dedicated Spacesynth community that is still producing and releasing this music, one LP at a time. They're probably from Finland.
Note: Do not confuse Spacesynth with Synthwave. Spacesynth is music from the 80s. Synthwave is music that tries to sound like an idealized 80s. That is an important, if perhaps irrelevent, distinction.

## Italo Disco
*aka:  Italo, Italo Pop* in the Eurodisco scene, emerged in early 80s

Italo Disco is what happens when creativity, inspiration, and raw ambition vastly exceed technical limitations.
Giorgio Moroder (an actual Italian) may have brought pure electronic music to the clubs with his Hi NRG galloping synths, but electronic Disco was still beholden to a lot of acoustic equipment for much of its instrumentation. Analog monosynths could only do so much and drum machines hadn't been perfected yet (Kraftwerk infamously built their own which is what kept them ahead of the game).
So for awhile a lot of Hi NRG was electronic except the drummer, who had to match the tempo-drifting analog synths like he was playing a primitive form of Rock Band, and all he's doing is hitting a 4-to-the-floor kickdrum for seven minutes which can get quite droll.
This all changed with the Linn LM-1 Drum Computer released in 1980, which enabled electronic Disco to become Italo Disco. Techno and House have the TR-909 and Electro and Bass have the TR-808, but Italo Disco has the Linn (and the Oberheim DMX, and later on the E-mu Drumulator).
This is the more popular (and cheaper) Linndrum released in 1982. After this point all hell broke loose.
The Linn was not just the first commercial programmable drum machine to hit the market, it was also the first to use drum samples instead of onboard wave generators. Built as a tool rather than a toy, the Linn's individual drum samples could be programmed and sequenced on the fly, a revolutionary feature at the time.
Everyone could see it coming. In 1975 if you wanted to make a Disco record, you needed a dozen session musicians for the horns, strings, rhythm guitar, walking bassline, extra drummers for bongos or toms, piano, backup singers, and John Travolta's chest hair.
By 1980 if you wanted to make a Disco record, all you needed was some synthesizers, a drum machine and some patience. And maybe a vocalist if you can't sing. But you still needed the chest hair.
The Linn (and all other drum machines) were crude lo-fi beasts in the 80s, brapping out thin and weak percussion. The solution was to sweeten the output signal with the gated reverb, a technique inadvertently invented by Phil Collins and codified in the AMS RMX-16 digital effects processor, released in 1981. Now tinny-sounding drum machines can sound like tinny-sounding drum machines in a large concert hall.
Italo Disco was the first fully electronic genre to hit the dancefloors, and despite the popularity of its cousins Hi NRG and Synthpop, it had the most staying power and the most retro chic when it comes to 80s revivalism. No one wants to remake SAW productions, but man that Silver Pozzoli track is just begging for a remake.
One of the more campy ironies about Italo is that most of the music was sung in English, a habitual second language to all of its artists. The reasoning behind this may have to do with English being the universal language of business and commerce in the modern world. And English contains more words than any other language making it the easiest language to rhyme. And it's also easiest to make indecipherable sense since the syntax is so flexible (no gender-specific pronouns, presence of homonyms, etc).
You can string English words together like fridge magnet poetry and it would mean something profound to someone. This produces hilarious, thick-accented, unintentionally funny-sounding lyrics which only makes the genre more adorable.
And Italians always anglicize their names. It's a tradition that extends to their movie industry and beyond.
Italo Disco didn't actually get the name "Italo Disco" until the mid-80s, and that's all due to the efforts of one label doing most of the heavy lifting: ZYX Music. While a lot of Italo artists were one-off aliases and fly-by-night projects, ZYX was the one name you can count on to keep the Italo flame burning. A German label proper, it put an actual name to the music when it began releasing compilations celebrating the music's underground dominance.
ZYX is quite possibly the most prolific record label in existence, boasting dozens of sublabels (many of them Italo-centric) and over ten thousand releases in over forty years, and it's still going strong. It's got a sizable back catalogue that it can continously mine for nostalgia revivalism in perpetuity.
Part of what makes Italo so addictive is that it is almost universally upbeat and triumphant. Never underestimate that Italian knack for catchy music that tugs at the brainstems. Even when the production gloss is thin and corny (this is decade-old music made on deprecated machines, after all), you have to respect the attempt at something uplifting and warm. While the execution may be flawed, the ideas are topnotch. That's a hint, producers: If you struggle for ideas, mine underground Italo tracks from the 80s. You won't be disappointed.

Italo is so awesome I made not one but TWO mixes of it. This is the upbeat "hot" mix.
	

Italo Disco birthed several unspecified subgenres in the 80s ranging from Spacesynthy to Synthpoppy to Hi NRGy. But probably the one subgenre that went on to greater things was Eurobeat, a supercharged genre that went on to dominate fitness competitions and Japanese arcade games.
Italo took a hiatus in the 90s but returned in the 2000s along with everything else nostalgic for the 80s, and now it's back with fierceness and improved production gloss. Which is all we really wanted, because when the music is this good there's no sense in not keeping it alive.
Ish.

# Europop

## Eurobeat
*aka:  Super Eurobeat, Euromach, J-Euro, Dance Dance Revolution* in the Europop scene, emerged in late 80s

Back in the 90s Eurobeat was the official music genre of funny fitness competitions on TV where the people never stop running in place.
Like this but with more pep.
This was enough to give it the stereotype as a "fitness" genre, which is why it was frequently used for rhythm and dance video games including Dance Dance Revolution, Stepmania, Pump It Up, In the Groove, Dance Evolution, Dance Hero, Dance Master, Dance Sensei, Dance Nazi, Dance in your pants, Dodecadance, Lord of the Dance, Dance You Motherfucker, Simon, Acrobatic Rock 'n' Roll, and all other button-tap timing games not named Guitar Hero.
But Eurobeat was not made specifically for Dance Dance Revolution (at least not until later). It predates the game by a good decade or so, with murky origins that might be somewhat obscure for anyone who has not fully charted the evolutionary progress of the major players of Italo Disco and Hi NRG in the 80s. We all did that, didn't we?
Eurobeat got its start as a mid-80s percolating percussion variant of Italo that aimed to compete with the galloping arps of Hi NRG and SAW-style productions. Because Italians knock off everything, even others who are knocking off them.
The first proto-Eurobeat track was probably Vanessa - Be My Lady, if only because it has the lovely Clara Moroni on vocals -- a studio rat and Italo veteran who lent her voice to dozens of aliases, projects, and hundreds of songs by my count.
What a Clara Moroni might look like.
Normally this wouldn't be very noteworthy, except that Ms. Moroni would eventually become the Queen of Eurobeat and founder of one of its biggest labels, Delta Records. So it's fitting that she was in on its first track, as opposed to some nameless one-off scraped off the dingy streets of some forgotten Lombard commune.
It was Be My Lady that established the Eurobeat template of offbeat bass stabs which, when sped up, give off a bouncey "DUNGA DUNGA DUNGA DUNGA" groove. Other stereotypes include blistering fast synthlines and pitched-up girly vocals that holler more than sing. Also: that Italian knack for triumphant choruses.
So if you have ever noticed that all Eurobeat female vocalists tend to sound the same, you're not imagining things. Clara Maroni owns this genre like supermodels own anorexia.
But it wasn't until the early 90s that Eurobeat picked up an extreme tempo shift -- as much as 40 bpm or more, almost as fast as Happy Hardcore -- into its signature fierce sonic sound assault that gave it the appellation "Super Eurobeat", and an increased interest in the genre from Japan. Because of course the Japanese would be all over something like this. They even invented a dance for it and everything.
This new Super Eurobeat was poppy enough for instant appeal and fast enough for Maniac level on Dance Dance Revolution. Its usage in the game prompted an explosion of Japanese Eurobeat, where J-Pop artists would release special Eurobeat remixes of their insidious karoake pop ballads, giving rise to the subgenre J-Euro.
This led to its usage in many Anime properties, specifically the racing manga Initial D, which has lent one of its most popular tracks -- Dave Rodgers - Deja Vu -- to a series of silly video memes involving unorthodox drifting of various sorts. Here's a compilation of them:

They get funnier the more you watch.
	

Eurobeat was always a genre that sold best through nameless compilations (singles were small, short, and rarely sold well), but Dance Dance Revolution was such a powerful presentation engine for the genre that the compilations adopted DDR box art for awhile.
Do what the colored arrows say, you obediant little prole.
As syrupy, sticky, gooey, sugary, honey sweet pop genres go, Eurobeat is alright. It's the kind of genre that would totally carry you on its shoulders back to the chopper in 'Nam.
Eurobeat's popularity directly corresponded with the rise and fall of the DDR franchise so the late 90s was its most explosive period. But it is still around today and a cursory google search of Eurobeat returns evidence that its major labels still exist and some of them are still dutifully pumping out a feverish number of compilations 20 years later.
Eurobeat has a special niche and an addictive quality that can't be quenched, and for the gamer who feels like getting some exercise every once in awhile, Eurobeat will be there to provide the backing track.
Ish.


## Asian Pop
*aka:  J-Pop, K-pop, Visual Kei, Shibuya-kei* in the Europop scene, emerged in early 90s

Asian Pop is not necessarily electronic, but a lot of it is and that's why it's here. This is probably not the best location for it but a lot of Asian Pop is heavily influenced by Europop, especially since one of the earliest and most successful J-Pop labels was Avex Trax, which got its start as a Far East distributor of Eurobeat, Hi NRG, and Italo Disco.
But I admit that I am slighting an entire scene of music and 1.7 bazillion people by putting it all in one genre.
Asian Pop is a massive scene with many regional genres including aforementioned J-Pop (Japan), K-Pop (South Korea), HK-Pop (Hong Kong), C-Pop (Taiwan), P-Pop (Philippines), T-Pop (Thailand), FE-Pop (non-descript Far East Pop), I-Pop (Indonesia), L-Pop (Laos), M-Pop (Malaysia), V-Pop (Vietnam), O-Pop (uh...Camb*O*dia?), Q-Pop (oh, there's gotta be something), R-Pop (Riau Islands), S-Pop (Singapore), and of course Shibuya-kei.
But the only ones worth talking about are J-Pop and K-Pop, because none of those other genres that I just made up are daily worldwide trending topics on Twitter.
What Asian Pop might look like.
J-Pop and K-Pop are dominated by pop idols, teen heartthrobs, androgynous boy groups and jailbait girl groups. So just like western teen pop.
But in the west pop idol groups were usually capped at five members, each marketed to a different caste of tween: The cute one, the tough one, the badboy rebel, the slutty one, the high maintenance one, the smart one, the leader, the loner, the joker, the smoker, the midnight toker, and other tropes culled from fiction (warning: TV Tropes. Time thief). This was borrowed from the five-member guitar band phenomenon that dominated western pop music in the 60s and 70s.
East Asia had no such cultural touchstone, so their pop groups could be any size they want -- in fact, the more the better. The absolute pinnacle of this is AKB48, a supergroup of 48 current members and hundreds of past members although only 16 of them are on stage at any one time. The rest are waiting on deck, like second stringers or a practice squad ready to come in if one of the starting lineup is sidelined 4-6 weeks with a torn ACL.
It's not a proper J-Pop group if it doesn't have a high sexual fetish quotient.
In the west, J-Pop was introduced initially through anime theme songs and any specialty shop that sold Japanese media. This exposure was expanded to the broader J-Pop canon with the help of the Internet -- the only technology that simultaneously breaks down barriers while erecting walls, opening opportunities while closing doors, and exposing sheltered minds to echo chambers of insulating fundamentalism driven by reinforced rhetoric and unconditional self-affirmation.
J-Pop right now is in a state of what people who cover this music for a living call a "warring idols period" -- too many idol groups, not enough fans. Oversaturation has led to goofy gimmicks, experimentation with other scenes or genres, and endless feuds between rival idol groups and their hardcore fans who memorize lyrics and dance moves like Bible passages.
Pop idol groups, managers, labels, and marketing agents are known for manufacturing scandals for cheap press and profit, although who knows how much of it is wrestling kayfabe and how much is an earnest anxiety to stand out and make it big in a very crowded and very limited marketplace.
Only Japan would make horror cute and sexy cf. Alice Juban.
So over the past decade J-Pop has been busy trying to eat its own neck while over in the west the otaku faithful are engaged in a bitter range war with the metal scene over whether Babymetal is cultural appropriation or not.
Amidst all this confusion and online warfare is the rise of the starry-eyed and Final Fantasy-haired pretty boy K-Pop idol group explosion (and no, it's not because of him. Well, maybe a little).
It's because of Stephen Colbert's epic feud with Rain.
K-Pop's success in the west is no accident. It actually has more western production gloss and marketing, and it doesn't have the creepy pedo fetish and other wierdness that infests so much J-Pop.
K-Pop rules the world now and I know that only because the only thing that could possibly push One Direction off the top worldwide trending topics on Twitter is a younger, prettier, fresher version of One Direction. That's the way tween trends do.
K-Pop is an extant phenomenon almost entirely because of the Internet. South Korea is a culture historically fraught with interpersonal shyness and a reserved state of being (you would be too if you had to live with China and Japan as neighbors for thousands of years and suffered brutal invasions from both of them). The Internet has helped Koreans reach out, express themselves, and showcase their unique personality in a way that is most aggreeable to their cultural norms: Starcraft tournaments and cheesy pop music.
Asian pop is a process just like any other pop music. It prizes style over substance, shiny hooks and shallow lyrics, sex appeal and designer fashion, and well-choreographed dancing. You don't have to be an anime-obsessed otaku to like this kind of music, nor a pre-teen girl. But if fandom is more important to you than the music, it helps.
Ish.


## Nu Italo
*aka:  Italo Dance, Italo Beat* in the Europop scene, emerged in late 90s

Nu Italo was a short-lived and explosive late 90s genre/fad that left in its wake a few memorable earworms, one dumb Internet meme, and a lot of flack.
Fortunately Nu Italo flared out in the early 2000s before the flack began but its influence lives on in Hip Hop and R&B of all places. Let me explain.
It's all because of Antares Auto-Tune.
What the original Auto-Tune might look like.
Released in 1997, Auto-Tune started off as a plug-in for Cakewalk, Protools and other DAWs, and that's pretty much what it still is today for Ableton, GarageBand, FL Studio, and even iPhone. But you can get rack modules now if hardware is your thing. It is not to be confused for Voiceboxes, Talkboxes, Vocoders, or other devices that augment, alter, modulate or dehumanize the human voice.
The purpose of Auto-Tune is to subtlely correct pitchy vocals and it actually does a good job of that but that's not the way anyone uses it, especially today. When it's abused Auto-Tune creates a yodelly digitized effect which sounds like someone trying to sing while moving their finger between their lips.
A year later, producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling used Auto-Tune on Cher - Believe which became a monster hit specifically because of the way they used Auto-Tune to accentuate the chorus. For awhile the technique was known as the "Cherbot" effect.
They initially denied that they used Auto-Tune as if fearing what might happen (with good reason) if the secret leaked out, making up some nonsense about the Cherbot really being a combination of a Korg VC10 and a Digitech Talker. No one believed them. The secret was out, and like a child on Christmas morning, producers had a new toy to play with.
It didn't take long -- literally a few months later -- for some keener Italian producers to apply Auto-Tune to not just the chorus but to all the vocals, heavily, so it was like a robot trying to sound human instead of a human that occasionally sings uncanny valleyish.
Along with a thick stomping slower-than-Eurodance beat, off beat bass stabs, something of a minimalist arrangement, and that Italian knack for a great hook, this new sound was catchy enough to spawn copycats and before long everyone was making music that sounded like Eiffel 65 - Blue.

There was a period in the 90s where movies, television, and music videos had horrendously bad CGI.(pretty sure Daft Punk ripped off this plot for Interstella)
	

Being yet another monster hit-making Italian phenomenon, no one was sure to call it mostly because Italians making hit underground pop music was so routine that they ran out of labels. Italo House, Italo Dance, Italo Beat, Italo Disco, Italo Pop were all in concurrent use. There was no general consensus on Nu Italo but no one balked at the name so it's the one I use. But you won't find it on any compilations or press releases the way other genres are whored out.
Eiffel 65-inspired Nu Italo dominated dance charts for a few years and at the time Auto-Tune was seen as just a novelty that would be gone and forgotten like everything else hideous and horrible in the late 90s, like capri pants or beanie babies. Really, there was nothing to be afraid of.
And then there was this fucking kid:
Eiffel 65 - Blue (1998) and O-Zone -  Dragostea Din Tei (2003) bookend the Nu Italo phenomenon. You could make a convincing argument that Gary Brolsma effectively killed it.
And just like that, Nu Italo was over. It came and went in the span of about five years, which is generally the peak period of any given genre's native sound. And Auto-Tune went with it.
And then two years later T-Pain resurrected it. And it's been a staple of Hip Hop and R&B ever since. Not even Jay-Z could stop it and that guy is married to Beyonce.
If you look up the history of Auto-Tune on the Internet, rarely anyone mentions the Nu Italo genre that really brought it into prominence. Some might mention Eiffel 65 in passing, but this sound technique was abused long before untalented R&B producers used it to hide the fact that they can't sing on key.
Just don't tell them that they're ripping off 20 year old Italian ideas.
Ish.


## Eurodance
*aka:  Dancepop, Europop, Swedish Pop, Italo Dance, Handbag House* in the Europop scene, emerged in early 90s

Not all cheesy genres are bad. Some are quite fun, and can be appreciated as shallow dumb entertainment like pro wrestling or Beavis & Butthead. Eurodance is one of those genres.
In the early 90s England had Rave, Belgium had Hip House, and Italy had Italo House. So why not put those genres in a blender and puree into a smoothie with the anthems of Rave, the rapping of Hip House and the divas of Italo House (with maybe the occasional piano flourish or two). Pour over Hi NRG galloping basslines and a really high pitched 909 kick so it's no longer a "THUMP" but rather a "DOLP DOLP DOLP DOLP" to give it some zing. And don't forget the melted cheddar cheese saw wave power chords to create the most delicious recipe in all of electronic music: Eurodance. The music that makes you do this:
It's unfortunate that such a lame sketch during Saturday Night Live's "repetition is funny" era had to sully the great Eurodance maestro Haddaway. But I'm sure he doesn't mind the royalties.
What makes this genre work is that the ingredients are set to correct proportions like all great recipes. The anthems are epic but not so epic that they invert into stupid. The divas are over-the-top but they don't take control of the song and strangle it to death like melisma-defiling Soul and R&B divas. The rapping is usually Dancehall and ranks just above Blondie in its content, delivery, and word choice, but that's okay because it's not supposed to be anything but 12-bar flavor text. Expecting deep lyrical political conscious shit would ruin the recipe. Moderation is key.
Individually none of these ingredients are strong enough to taste like anything. But put together they make a souffle genre that is greater than the sum of its parts. It is interesting to point this out because every other genre that has spawned from Eurodance gets the proportions all wrong, spoiling the roux (and you know who's fault that is).
Eurodance knows what it is and it knows its limitations. It doesn't try to be anything it's not. For that you have to respect it. And for such a commercial genre it has a surprising amount of range. It can be sugar sweet like Miss Papaya or Aqua, anthemic like 2 Unlimited or Capella, or a derivative ABBA ripoff like Ace of Bass or A*Teens.

Some Eurodance can even be quite dark, like this working print music video for Real McCoy - Run Away which was never released due to its oppressive Orwellian overtones that depict a dystopian future where people are forced to fill out documents on typewriters while listening to Eurodance. Keeps me awake at night.
	

Eurodance is known by an assortment of other names (it's mostly just considered pop music in Europe), but the most interesting nickname is Handbag House, so named after flocks of girls who would congregate in dance circles around piles of their handbags on the dancefloor. Because girls love Eurodance like Germans love David Hasselhoff.
Eurodance wasn't just a Euro thing either. It also had a huge contingent in Canada -- well Montreal really, which is the most European city you can visit without actually going to Europe. 
Numuzik Inc. provided the federally mandated Canadian content for Muchmusic's Electric Circus, a dance show of the north (think Soul Train but much, much whiter, with Tim Hortons and hockey slang) that served as the pulse of the nation's nightlife until it went to shit in the late 90s due to incompetence of the program organizers and the station as a whole. And also Chris Shepherd, the Canadian producer with the most indeterminate English accent I've ever heard. Seriously: What part of England is he trying to sound like he's from?
Of course, who needs music channels or dance shows these days when there's Youtube and Mixcloud.

Believe it or not but Eurodance is actually one of the more challenging genres to mix.
	

As the decade wore on Eurodance smoothed out its multi-ethnic origins into something whiter and more girly. The first to go was the Dancehall rapping, initially replaced by dorky white guy rapping, and eventually dropped altogether.
Next to go were the galloping basslines which I guess sounded too gay and Disco for 90s mainstream audiences. And then the divas disappeared, replaced by cute blond-haired models with a German country twang in their inflections.
By the end of the decade Eurodance was indistinguishable from the chart-crushing, club-dominating white bread genre of Vocal Trance, inheriting the two worst things to happen to Trance music in the late 90s: Anthems and crooning bints.
To the pretentious snobs who complain that Eurodance is cheesy girly music -- well yeah. It is. That's its appeal. Exactly how many girls do you see at your Rush concerts?
If you are a club owner or promoter and you want to find a way to get girls into your club, you can never go wrong with Eurodance. And Abba. Or Eurodance remixes of Abba. The holy grail of Handbag House.
Ish.


## Handsup
*aka:  Hands Up, Dancecore, Vocal Hardstyle* in the Europop scene, emerged in early 00s

Handsup or Dancecore is Vocal Hardstyle, and yes that's as stupid as it sounds. So stupid that it's not considered part of the Hard Dance pantheon. They want nothing to do with it.
If you thought Vocal Trance was the shit, Handsup is Vocal Trance on steroids. Looking totally shredded like super hardcore. Because it's a real man's girly genre.
Handsup got its start as an umbrella catch-all for any not-quite-Eurodance, not-quite-Eurotrance, not-quite-Hardstyle harder brand of non-commercial commercial dance music that Special D and Rob Mayth would typically cane in the early 2000s. It is very much a kleptocratic genre, stealing the heavy kicks and basslines from Hardstyle, vocals from Happy Hardcore, and anthems from soccer stadiums. Handsup's original goal was to leach off Eurotrance's audience who like to dance with their arms in the air like they're at a creepy religious revival.
God doesn't think he's Tiesto.
You might think that this is the Dutch up to their usual bullshit again, but for once the Netherlands is not to blame for this one, and that may be the one saving grace about Handsup: It was not created, coddled and controlled by the Dutch. This is actually a German genre, and as far as I know it doesn't leave Germany very much, like saurkraut, Berliner Minimal Tech, or the German army post-1945.
If Handsup has one track I like, it's Basshunter - Boten Anna and only because of its hilarious lyrical content and music video that harkens the wild west days of the 90s Internet and mIRC.
It is a simple story about a guy who falls in love with Anna, an chatbot that kicks and bans people with reckless abandon, but it is a tragic tale as he soon learns that Anna is not a bot at all but in fact a real live girl, and it breaks his heart because it was the bot he loved, not the woman. She'll always be a bot to him.
At least, I think that's what it was about. My Swedish is really rusty. Here's the original video:

Do not look up any other "official" music videos of this song, remixes, or translations. Especially the English language alternate lyrics version Now You're Gone. They are all poo.
	

Like the rest of the genres in Europop, Handsup isn't to be taken too seriously. It has dwelled in relative obscurity for nearly two decades but you get the sense that it could be on the verge of a massive commercial breakthrough. All it needs is that gentle pop nudge -- like say a K-Pop band releases a Handsup single (no, not like that) or a Handsup remix of Beyonce blows up in the clubs, and we're off. It could happen, because Handsup contains all those precious ingredients that you find in pop music.
Except for, you know, actually being popular.
Ish.


## Vocal Trance
*aka:  Vocal Trance* in the Europop scene, emerged in late 90s

Vocal Trance is either Eurodance mk II or Eurotrance with vocals, depending on which one you think is worse. It is not an improvement of either genre (not that Eurotrance was some magnanimous and priceless work of historical heritage that invited preserving the sanctity of its cultural lineage to begin with, but whatever).
Trance was never supposed to be a vocal scene. When it did contain vocals it was usually an old sci-fi movie quote or a spoken word sermon about chakras or some such nonsense. It was never lyrical vocals. You know, that are sung. Like a song. At karoake night at the ski & country club that sells pumpkin spiced vegan Nutella greek yogurt low fat soy latte to up-talking valley girls taking Instagram selfies wearing yoga pants and Ugg boots from Forever 21. But I digress.
This of course ended the day Trance picked up the pop song structure to become Eurotrance, a feat only moderately more difficult than converting oxygen into carbon dioxide.
Vocal Trance came about because some keen marketers realized that if you take the anthems of Eurotrance and insert some silly tart singing about love and destiny, you have completed the reverse-metamorphosis of the beautiful butterfly Trance into its final form: A bulbous larval monstrosity that does nothing but eat and shit pretty melodies. Because pop music always needs a singer trilling about some trite thing in order to secure that lucrative shower-singing-into-shampoo-bottle market.
Vocal Trance mixes look like Cosmo covers.
Much like pop music, Vocal Trance relies on session musicians to make the music and cover models to sell it, but it's really just Trance producers employing the Andrew Lloyd Weber Strategy For Nailing Hot Chicks: Approach model, use heavily accented pickup line that you are big music producer and need vocalist for next track and invite her back to your studio/apartment with shag carpeting and dim lighting, a time-honored technique so called because it worked on Sarah Brightman for nearly ten years.
What a Vocal Trance "vocalist" might look like. This genre couldn't get any whiter if you bleached it in the sun for a thousand years, bathed it in milk, smothered it in sour cream and buried it in marshmellows, flour and freshly fallen snow.
Vocal Trance singers tend to sing the same, with this breathy, soft moaning type of vocal fry style that neither has power nor persuasiveness, almost as if they're not actually good singers but they are good looking so despite their limited range producers can do a lot to hide their deficiencies anyway (the solution is reverb. Lots and lots of reverb). What matters is that they're good looking. You will never find an ugly Vocal Trance singer.
This style of singing was probably started by Kristy Hawkshaw (yes, THE Kristy Hawkshaw), unless it was Jan Johnston, but it was perfected by Dominique Rijpma van Hulst and a bazillion other forgettable Dutch starlets. Like Hardwell needs help getting laid.
Vocal Trance is probably the most popular form of "trance" today, to such an extent that it's probably the only thing people think of when they hear the word Trance now. Go on Youtube and look up Trance mixes, it's almost all Vocal Trance (the rest is Armin fanboys trying to recreate famous ASOT episodes. He's up to like 900 now).
With Vocal Trance being so girly you might begin to wonder: What would a manly man's pec-blasting, red meat chewing, harley riding, totally heterosexual Axe body spray version of Vocal Trance sound like? ...Handsup.
Ish.

# Eurotrance

## Dutch House
*aka:  Anthem House* in the Eurotrance scene, emerged in late 00s

You can always count on the Dutch to try a stupid thing once, and then keep doing it over and over again well past the point of social acceptance (they invented Capitalism so they are really good at rapacious exploitation of market trends).
Dutch House is a brilliant (and by brilliant I mean completely stupid) attempt to upgrade Anthem House for modern audiences, which were less about the anthems and more about the bass anthems (so only moderately less stupid).
What a dutch house might look like.
It was inevitable that by the late 2000s the breakdown-build-anthem formula would have diminishing returns so producers saw nothing wrong with a little shakeup in the stale gimmick.
On top of that the nascent rise of Dubstep challenged Anthem House and Eurotrance's main stage festival dominance with its new formula of breakdown-build-drop (you know, only superficially different. Millenials like to rename everything and then pretend that they invented it. For instance Ecstasy is now called Molly).
So anthem-addicted Dutch producers with delusions of adequacy upgraded their sound to appeal to the first wave of Millenials (82-90) entering their prime partying years (18-24), and hands-in-the-air supersaw anthems just didn't have the attraction that an impressive wall of teeth-chattering lower midrange "bass" could. The thing they invented was: The anti-anthem.
The anti-anthem is the exact opposite of the anthem. The track keeps the breakdown and build structure but there's no explosive crescendo. It just rolls out into something weak and non-energetic, sometimes nothing more than a kick and a synthline.
At first people thought it was a mistake, like the DJ fader-slammed to a different track at the wrong time. Some DJs have used this misconception to legitimately cut to soft rock tracks as a troll. One of the more famous trolls is to cut to Spandau Ballet - True. Incidentally, if you are a DJ, don't do this. Try to find good reasons to play music, not dumb shit gimmicks. This is a huge digression.
Chuckie probably invented this one (while another one of his tracks was remixed into Moombahton by Afrojack, making these by proxy sister genres and the least white music you will ever hear in The Netherlands).
It was received rather luke warmly until Martin Garrix - Animals destroyed record charts in 2014 -- a perfect symbiotic gestalt of Anthem House anthems and Dutch House drop to nothing. Because you know what they say: You can take the anthem away from the Dutch but you can never take the Dutch away from the anthem (I don't even know what that means or whether they even say it).
And then there's these fucking guys:
I don't know what name is more ridiculous, Blasterjaxx or Guardians of the Galaxy's Taserface. At this point the Dutch have to be fucking with us. Seriously, what the fuck is this bullshit? No, really. Are they seriously shitting us with this?
This era is the one we are in right now, with bass-heavy drops replacing uplifting anthems. Equally as insipid and less than insightful. But much like their East India Company, someday this Dutch era will end, and the rest of us will look back on it and wonder why we ever paid attention to them in the first place.
Ish.


## Anthem House
*aka:  Stadium House, Epic House, Arena Rock, Big Room, Main Room, Club House* in the Eurotrance scene, emerged in early 90s

Anthem House is what happens when a guy with his finger perpetually stuck inside his own rectum occasionally pulls it out and hits the keyboard with it, one key at a time.
Anthem House is every House genre's attempt to sound like nothing resembling House, which is why it more accurately belongs in the Eurotrance scene because Eurotrance is the bukakke of bombastic anthemic bullshit.
Gone are the blues and disco influences. Anthem House has replaced its groove-centric Chicago affectations with Fisher Price melodies fed through a couple detuned supersaws on a Roland JP 8080. Or some such similar nonsense (everyone uses DAWs these days).
It was invented by The KLF who were most certainly not trying to create a pop underground genre and in all likelihood were taking the piss which is not the most firm foundation to use as a template for dancefloor domination over the next 30 years. But it should be noted that their "Stadium House Trilogy" (as they called it) at one point dominated five entire music scenes (Acid, Trance, Eurodance, Hip House/Progressive House and whatever the Belgians were doing), probably unintentionally but it's still pretty impressive.
Everyone -- and I mean everyone -- from Belgian Rave stompers to UK Progressive Househeads -- rode the wake of The KLF's anthemic crescendos and there are still copycats today trying to pathetically emulate their formula.

Just because The KLF were good at making pop music doesn't mean they liked it. As a forerunner to the K Foundation, here they are at the "Helter Skelter" rave in 1989 throwing trash bags full of money into the crowd. Filthy money. Diseased, dirty, poisoned money. Money made off the desiccated carcas of the pop music industry. Bon appetite.(they may have gotten this idea from The Joker's parade in Batman)(The KLF - What Time Is Love (Pure Trance))
	

Introducing Rave-style anthems to House music was not a clever thing nor a very complicated thing, but making it hip and catchy did require some skill which some were better at than others.
The earliest Anthem House was a poppier, friendlier version of Rave (or Progressive House, depending on who made it or where it came from. Hint: Listen for the crowd cheering samples, something ubiquetous to early Anthem House and later on Happy Hardcore and sometimes UK Hardhouse but literally nowhere else), and was a stepping stone to the cheesiest of guilty pleasures: Eurodance.
There have been a number of Anthem House hits over the years, some of which are positively awful and have absolutely no right being popular, while others found themselves inserted into Jock Jams compilations or as pre-faceoff music at hockey games.
But probably the one monster track that means the most to the underground at the time was Faithless - Insomnia.

Disclosure: I can recite the entire rap on the 9-minute 12" mix on command. It's something all 90s ravers can do.
	

Released in 1995, Insomnia set the template for all anthems thereafter: A breakdown that lasts over a minute, a snare roll build of 8 bars or more, and a crescending anthem to get everyone to hop up and down. The anthem in this case was created with the Pizzicato patch on the Roland JD-990 synthesizer which was the rack module of the Roland JD-800.
What a JD-990 might look like
For a few years, a lot of producers from Sash! to DJ Quicksilver all used this same Pizzicato patch. And a new generation came of age under the impression that to make a hit track, you had to have a build, a breakdown, and an anthem in your song. Like pop music's verse-bridge-chorus template. They might have even made a stupid fucking movie about it or something. It was fun for one song but every song thereafter gets extremely predictable and tiring.
It seemed that not just House but Eurotrance recognized the importance of a well-timed snare roll and crescending anthem, not just in this track but in every track. All the time. Multiple times in every track. And then Eurotrance would go on to egregiously abuse the tactic well past the point of acceptable norms, like fisting in public.
Like a lot of other longstanding genres (Balearic, Progressive Breaks, Experimental), Anthem House is very trendwhorish in that it always adopts whatever is big at the time. It has to if it wants to maintain its status as the "dancefloor king", as if that's an important thing to be.
When Disco House was hot, Anthem House sounded like Disco House but with anthems. When French House was big, Anthem House sounded like French House but with Anthems. When Electrohouse blew up, Anthem House sounded like Electrohouse but with anthems. And when Dutch House became a thing, Anthem House said "nah" since it was doing something called the anti-anthem.
Concordantly, people have called Anthem House different names over the years. No one calls it Stadium House anymore. In fact I don't think anyone ever called it Stadium House outside of The KLF's original trilogy since it evokes images of big power chords from arena rock bands, but what is Anthem House really but big power chord arena music?
Anthem House isn't electronic music, this is Smoke On The Water for synthesizer fans. It's not exactly known for its subtlety. It's not meant for dingy cafes and eateries, it wants to punch you in the face with its soccer hooligan chant lead melodies.
The most recent term for this music that is almost exclusively used by Millenials is "Big Room". You know, the place where the Swedish House Mafia leaves their colostomy bag. It doesn't need a new name. It's all just reptilian-brained shower-humming Anthem House music.
Anthem House will never go away because it always takes whatever is currently ruling the dancefloors and adds big, shiny, sing-a-long anthems to it, and like a cat chasing a laser pointer people will never get tired of the infantile distraction of fidget spinners anthems.
Ish.


## Eurotrance
*aka:  Euro Disney Cheese, Uplifting Trance, Anthem Trance, Stadium Trance, Melodic Trance, Epic Trance, Angelic Trance, Dutch Trance, Trance Trance Doodly Pants* in the Eurotrance scene, emerged in mid 90s

Eurotrance is a festering, pus-filled boil on the anus of electronic music, combining the worst aspects of everything despicable about crass consumerism, soap advertisement jingles, and egregious self-aggrandizement of delusional frauds who rate alongside reality show contestants, media whores, multi-level marketers, and political lobbyists on the grand list of "things we must put on a rocket ship destined for the sun".
The rank repugnance of the self-fellating culture of DJ worship is at the forefront of this many-headed hydra of rapacious rot. Overbearing anthems, boring breakdowns, and tasteless DJ vanity have combined into one monstrous, obnoxious, pompous, unlistenable Babylonian nega-demon. Who is to blame for unleashing such a hideous beast of seething filth upon our ears?
Oh, it's the Dutch. It's always the fucking Dutch.
Susie's report is on Evil Death Psychocore.
It's important to first explain the horrible template that ruined Trance music. Somehow a musical artform that devoted itself to hypnotic rhythms and spacey soundscapes became, inside of a decade, a mass produced assembly line McProduct for middle class Europeans (pejoratively known as Trancecrackers because they're white. Terribly, tragically, sunblindingly, basic-bitch-ordering-a-pumpkin-spice-latte white) who should have not spent their young adulthood clubbing but rather dying horribly in another continent-engulfing conflict (I mean, come on: Europe is due).
It wasn't that the stupid masses opened their minds to the revolutionary underground sounds of Trance. It's that Trance reformed itself into a pop model to appeal to their infantile desire for chocolate frosted sugar bombs. By following the verse-bridge-chorus pop template into the breakdown (quiet part with rising tension and no kick), build (big snare roll), anthem (catchy crescending fanfare that you will hum to yourself later), Trance became what it originally set to distance itself from. It's like the pigs in Animal Farm becoming more human-like by novel's end while claiming the whole time that humans are bad.
Let me show you what I mean. Here is an audio spectrum output of a typical Eurotrance track. You can tell, just by the frequency bursts, where the beat stops and where it starts again:

Why are there so many stoppages in this stupid song? Why is there not one but two minute long momentum killing breakdowns? They serve no purpose. You are standing there waiting for the track to resume and it's not going to bring the beat back for over a minute. There are almost as many beatless bars as there is not.
And this is a typical Eurotrance track. Some of the worst ones have two or even three minute breakdowns (I have even clocked one at 3m34s). Multiple times each track. You're supposed to be dancing, not standing there rolling your eyes while the DJ basks in his "I CAN MUSIC!" pose.
Never met a single Eurotrance DJ who was any better than any two-bit local.
That's a really long time for nothing to occur. As a good friend once told me: "Get on with it! I can only hold my arms in the air for so long!"
Of course club owners love these tracks because when the breakdown hits everyone leaves the floor and goes to the bar for a drink.
Rave music was a tough sell in the clubs in the early days because ravers were notorious non-drinkers (they brought their own drugs) and alcohol sales are how clubs stay solvent. But as soon as tracks with this "go to the bar" feature came out, which happens at least once every six minutes (about the time it takes to finish your drink and desire another), club owners finally saw the appeal of DJ-based music.
Trance breakdowns and anthems came from German Trance originally, but German Trance was fast and upbeat and liked to keep things moving. The breakdowns were no more than 16 bars tops (and the builds no more than 4). And then Progressive Trance extended these things so the breakdowns were 32 bars and the builds 8. And it would do this twice per track, giving the DJ time to go for a smoke break between mixes (not that Trance DJs did much mixing anyway). Eurotrance essentially went one further and made the breakdowns 64 bars or more, prolonging the agony. And the longer the breakdown the bigger the anthem.
This had the unfortunate consequence of creating an arms race among producers. Since anthems were the keystone of a Trance clubnight, with the DJ playing the most epic anthem at the peak moment, every producer fought to be that anthem. So they competed to create the most massive anthems. And since the anthems were all the clubbers could remember the next day, those were the tracks that stood out.
(side note: In economic theory, this is why competition is not always a good thing. It can lead to a race for the bottom, with each competitor making things worse by taking things one step further with each iteration. For instance: Surplus labor in a global economy)
So within a year every Trance track was an anthem. No rhythm, no journey, no gradual tension and release, no sense of restraint or subtlety. Just wall-to-wall in-your-face all-night-long anthems interrupted with nothing-going-on check-your-watch heavy-sigh breakdowns. And the problem got worse as the new millenium rolled over. The anthems got bigger, louder, longer, and more epic.
Ground zero for the Trance scene moved from the UK to the Netherlands which is the absolute worst thing you want to happen to your music scene. As soon as the Dutch get into it, it's all over. They will always make a cheese shite version of it without fail.
By 2001 the anthems settled on a refined formula culminating in the dominance of the Supersaw -- the blaring beehive wall-of-sound anthem technique raped to death by Dutch producers with the Roland JP-8000 analogue modelling synthesizer.
What a Roland JP-8000 might look like.To create the supersaw, generate two overlaid saw waves, detune one 50% above the other, and run them through two ADSR, one filter and one envelope. Play out in minor key chord progression (any progression will do). Takes five minutes to make a million dollar hit track. Conversely, you can also use Native Instrument's Pro 53 subtractive virtual synth for your supersaws (but it's not as good as the original thing on a JP-8000 or JP-8080).
It's only when Trance brought itself down to the level of the lowest common denominator did it become wildly popular on an unprecedented level. And like anything popular it subsisted on a well-worn gimmick that was quickly copied, exploited, milked dry, chewed up and spat out.
Eurotrance producers became addicted to the insta-fame of the new Anthem Trance. They became accustomed to the ease of which a hit record could be made (and hookers and blow could be procured -- truth be known It's All Gone Pete Tong is only 10% satire).
Eurotrance producers refused to take risks, innovate, produce, succeed, or excel in music. They grew lazy and complacent. It was far easier, after all, to simply replicate the same track every weekend with the same template. They churned out Pulp Trance, manufactured assembly line McTrance, generic and derivative commercial schlock intended for mass consumption. Eurotrance is to electronic music what Thomas Kinkade is to art.
My photoshop of this cynical cash grab -- a mix series with no mixing, stuffed with the biggest hits of the late 90s and early 00s. As if trancecrackers had never heard of these tracks before.
Naturally this shitty basic music for grandmothers and 8-year-olds made Eurotrance DJs the most popular in the world (and they still are to some extent). I could blame the trancecrackers for not knowing any better but not really because it's not their fault -- trancecrackers cling to Armin's butthole like a poo-eating lamprey. So I don't blame them. Instead I blame Armin.
Armin -- hell, all Eurotrance DJs are objectively and legitimately bad at what they do. They have no range, no vision, no concept of tension and release, can't phase lock, can't scratch, can't beat juggle, shitty levels, unoriginal mixing, lazy beatmatching (software fixes most of their mistakes now but back in the day every transition was ka-lump ka-lump ka-lump ka-lump), and they don't play anything obscure or interesting; they only whore out their own (and their label's) tracks, which means you're not actually watching a DJ, you're watching a 1.5 hour commercial for this dickhole's music business. And they spend 90% of the time with their hands in the air, hopping up and down like total goofballs instead of actually doing their fucking job.
Seriously, what is this? What the fuck is he doing? Why is anyone interested in this retarded puppet show?
Armin and Tiesto are to DJing what The Phantom Menace is to movies. You only like them because you think the pod race is cool. And the rest of Eurotrance? Michael BaSPLOSIONS!
Of course the sickening scourage of Eurotrance could not last and as the generations rolled over there were diminishing returns, especially since the pop club world moved onto the next big fad which was ELECTRO music (which wasn't Electro) and then DUBSTEP music (which wasn't Dubstep) and then BIG ROOM music (which was just Anthem House).
While the particulars of the sound aesthetics have changed, interestingly the template has not: There are still the big breakdowns, energetic builds and shiny anthems afflicting popular electronic music and probably will forever because that's the recognizable and the familiar to the world of pop music.
If that's your jam, good for you. Maybe you need breakdowns, builds, and anthems to tell you how to enjoy music. Maybe you also wear a bib when you eat and use training wheels when you ride your bike, too.
But some people don't need those things in their music because they're not a fucking child. Because they can recognize tension and release without needing to be hit over the head with it. And because they want the so-called top DJs in the world to actually do their jobs instead of trainwreck all night, dial it in, and cane shallow melodic garbage while waving their arms in the air like a bunch of self-important no-talent wankers.
If you aren't bothered by that, then fine. I'm not going to tell you to stop liking crap. Just understand that you like crap. You are the problem. You are the reason there are five live-action Transformers movies.
Ish.

# Hard Dance

## German Trance
*aka:  Hard Trance, Hard Acid Trance, Makina* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in early 90s

German Trance (not to be confused with Trance which was technically German Trance though no one called it that) was a bold uptempo fusion of Trance, Rave, and Acid. Sort of.
Its original name was Hard Trance because Trance had never been this thumping and blistering fast before (not even Goa was this fast...yet). Then after Hard Trance became a thing this sound was labeled as a short-lived mid 90s oddity produced almost exclusively by Germany (and non-Germans trying their hardest to sound German, and quite successfully I might add).
This scene -- Hard Dance -- did not exist at the time. It was coined after the 2000s when it seemed necessary to lump together like-minded genres favored by DJs for a specific class of raver: The jibtek warrior.
Just about anything fast and bouncey was considered Hard Dance at the time, from NRG to Hardstyle and even UK Hardcore and Happy Hardcore and Hard Acid Trance (German Trance and Hard Acid Trance are indistinguishable, separated only by geographic disposition. Hard Acid Trance is what they called it in the UK).
Like Dream Trance, German Trance (especially oldskool German Trance) is also a very specific genre with very specific criteria and hardly any deviation: Booming uptempo kicks (140+ bpm), growling acid lines and acid barks, gated choir voices (or just gated pads in general), and an isolated piano melody for some reason. Always that upper register piano melody, not a smooth Mediterranean melody like Dream Trance but rather an earnest melody full of fiery panic like a not-so-smooth Dream Trance. Think the opening bars of Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells. But faster and more urgent.
German Trance was where the breakdown-build-anthem template that infects all latter Eurotrance got its start. The good news is it's not drawn out and obnoxious and a waste of your god damn time like so much shitty Dutch music, but rather just a momentary break in the action before they bring it all back.
German Trance breakdowns are tolerable because they never lose momentum. The kick may be gone but there is still that off-beat bass stab keeping your attention. Nothing is brought to an absolute standstill -- German Trance is "Let's Go!" music.
The Germans make excellent anthems. They are tight and bright, efficient and sufficient, pentatonic and teutonic, precise and concise, observable and discernible, and apparent and transparent like fine German engineering. You won't hear any syncopation or swing rhythms here. They don't dwell on flowery bombastic nonsense and everything is locked to the beat because this is pogo-dancing music (well all Hard Dance music is, really) with only the occasional off-beat fluourish. This is by far the whitest groove you'll ever find.
There is a Spanish variant of German Trance called Makina. If Makina has one claim to fame , it's Newton - Streamline, best known as the track Jimmy Fallon danced to on top of a car in a Pepsi commercial. So that's something.

Like all proud jibtek warriors, Jimmy put meth in his Pepsi.
	

German Trance is just about the absolute limits of cheese that Trance should have succumbed to. Unfortunately the Dutch never know when to stop raping a dead thing well past its sexiness quotient and they turned the cheesiest cheddar Trance into industrial strength, concentrated, distilled and refined pure-grade weaponized limburger. But you shouldn't shy away from this stuff. Just stay away from the jibtek warriors.

I made this as a tribute to the First Lord of German Trance Gary D. the day after he died.
	

German Trance did not last long as by the late 90s jibtek culture had a lot more options for flailing about -- namely, NRG/UK Hardhouse from the UK andHardstyle from the Netherlands.
That makes this genre prime for a throwback/revivalism period but Hard Dance seems to want things to stay hard (or get harder) and in hindsight German Trance was just never that hard to begin with. Fast, but not hard. Never confuse the two.
Ish.


## Hard Trance
*aka:  Hard Trance* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in late 90s

Hard Trance superceded Hard (German) Trance, necessitating the need to rename the earlier stuff because it didn't sound like the latter stuff. This rarely happens in electronic music. Usually the first genre gets to keep the name (by way of the universal law of finders keepers) but that didn't happen here for some reason.
A lot of scenes have their token "hard" genres with varying amounts of heavyness or loudness invoked. Sometimes it's just abrasive sonic textures or dark themes and content. Trance seems to think that "hard" means a big booming kick and screaming anthems, which is hard the way yogurt is spicey.
So all the genres spawned from German Trance (neé Hard Trance) in this scene are not hard as much as they are just loud and obnoxious. They're just trying too hard (pun unintended), like that one metal friend invited to a Hip Hop party trying to be all edgey and hardcore.
Hard Trance was the first foray into this realm of really loud, dumb, obnoxious Trance music. You could call it the foremost of the "hard" genres, although I suppose if you shove your head far enough up your own ass you can be both the foremost and the rearmost of something. It has all the trappings of Eurotrance just with a far more compressed kick and in-your-face production gloss. Instead of uplifting the anthems are basically soccer hooligan chants echoed by stadiums of drunken louts at Sensation Black.
Sensation Black is a giant clubnight hosted by ID&T where everyone wears black and headbangs to Hard Trance. Its counterpart is Sensation White where everyone wears white and puts their arms in the air to Uplifting Trance. Nice to see The Netherlands show some diversity and cover both kinds of music. They're still a bunch of elitist snobs for kicking Rob Gee off the stage for having the temerity to play something different. Like they're suddenly Mr. I'm Too Classy to Go to a Strip Club During the Day.
The culture did not get much better, either. With the arrival of this music the jibtek warrior was pushed aside in favor of the Euro metal guido, better known as the soccer hooligan. The music came from several sources including Belgium and Germany, but it was in The Netherlands -- that Newtonian physics-defying black hole of suck -- where it was incubated into a refined form of potent Hardstyle.
There may be a compulsion to consider this simply a stepping stone to Hardstyle, but resist the temptation to see things this way. Even though the two are very similar and are played alongside one another, they are decidedly different and they trace different trajectories over the years.
The key difference between Hard Trance and Hardstyle is that Hard Trance at least still has some trancey elements in it (especially supersaw anthems, if you can call supersaws Trance at all). Hardstyle abandons all pretense of the old German Trance sound entirely and goes full Dutch (especially in the 2000s). And you never want to go full Dutch with your music.
Hard Trance still exists today but it has become almost indistinguishable from regular Eurotrance (while Hardstyle has become practically Gabber). While that means you should probably move on and read Hardstyle next, I don't recommend it. It won't end well.
Ish.


## Hardstyle
*aka:  Hardstyle* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in late 90s

It is time now for us to have a conversation about the Dutch. Their food is shit, their economics is shit, their sex acts are shit, even their soccer players are shit (except for this guy, he cool).
Now, I can forgive The Netherlands for Moombahton, or Gabber, and maybe even Eurotrance or Vocal Trance up to an extent (I mean: Any country that can foist Venga Boys and Alice Deejay upon the world has something seriously wrong with it so we should've known they were up to something). But I draw the line at Hardstyle. 
This is just bad music. This is beyond corny, even for Dutch music. And it's not the good kind of corny like Police Academy 3, but rather the sad, tragic kind of corny like Police Academy 7. This whole country must be stopped.
What can be said about Hardstyle? Well it borrowed ideas from Jumpstyle and Hard Trance and it was a quick conversion. If you flipped a coin on which genre -- Hardstyle or Hard Trance -- is worse, the coin would land on its edge.
Hardstyle took everything the Dutch typically ruin with electronic music and cranked it up past 11. The super compressed and pitched kicks making a goofy "DOING DOING DOING DOING" sound, the nauseating screaming anthems, the tiresome breakdowns, the obtrusive off-beat bass stabs so overdriven that they're just a big "WOMP WOMP WOMP WOMP" in-your-face cacophonous swill, the lack of any self-awareness or productive inventiveness.
This is annoying jump-scare music. It would be funny -- almost a parody of hard music -- if it weren't such a sad microcosm of everything wrong with the Dutch. This is fucking looney toons.
"I are Dutch. I spin shitty Hardsteil. I haf 12 folloowers oon soocial meedia und I'm signed to Spinnin' Recoords."
Hardstyle has a lot of similarities to a newborn baby, in that both are excrement factories. There is nothing redeemable about this flavorless, funkless, metronomic wall of screaming noise garbage.
This sound was been double baked, fired, refried, dehydrated, plastered, and reinforced with rebar into a mold that has not been altered in nearly 20 years. Thousands of tracks all cut from the same factory assembly process. And they keep making more. It's like whale vomit -- it just keeps coming.
Showing someone who's never heard Hardstyle before the best Hardstyle tracks trying to convert them is like sending someone a dick pic. Like supply side economics, there's no proof that it has ever worked yet guys keep doing it thinking the next time will be different.
Dutch chavs: Stop showing people your Hardstyle tracks. In fact just stop showing off your music altogether. It's not having the effect you think it's happening.
This is a PSA from the Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium.
Ish.



## Jumpstyle
*aka:  Jumpen, Jump, Euro Hard House* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in late 90s

Jumpstyle is an example of convergent evolution.
This genre emerged in Belgium in the late 90s and it sounds exactly like Chicago Hard House, with the slightly overdriven kick, snare, hi-hat, tom, rimshot, clap, even cymbal (optional) all on the same beat. This is unique for a Hard Dance genre because every other genre has some off-beat nuttiness going on with it (usually OOMPAH bass stabs). Jumpstyle is a departure from the mean.
Chicago Hard House came first, and then Jumpstyle developed slightly later almost oblivious to it. At least, I'm not aware of any cross-polination of ideas but since it's Belgium, it might be a given. That's their formula: Take a Chicago style of music and make it European (see: Hip House). Jumpstyle even has its own subgenre of Booty House (Bootystyle?) just like Chicago Hard House. That can't possibly be a coincidence.
Where Jumpstyle differs from Chicago Hard House (and the difference is subtle and quite possibly superficial) is its Europeanness. There's no better way I can put it. Allow me to explain:
European electronic music in general is just cheesier than non-Europe (especially America) music. It doesn't matter whether the scene is Trance, Techno, Hardcore, or even Downtempo Acid Nu Skool Trapstep -- the European version is always cheesier and more anthemic.
American producers like to make music for cultures rather than markets (ie: black music for black people, gay music for gay people, Christian music for Christians, etc.). European producers like to make music for everybody, which is why so much music from non-English countries is sung in English because it is the de facto language of business and commerce in the world. At least that's my theory.
But European music does have a certain quotient to it that makes it sound Euro hence why there are so many separate "Euro" scenes in this guide: Europop, Eurotrance, Eurodisco -- because the non-Euro versions don't sound very Euro. I know that's a tautology, but Euro music is music that sounds Euro. I blame Eurovision.
(note: I don't consider the UK to be Euro)
No discussion of Jumpstyle can be complete without describing the peculiar form of dancing that evolved with it. All Hard Dance genres encourage pogo-dancing to some degree, but Jumpstyle does it differently: Pogo-dancing on one foot.
They even have tournaments and leagues over this. Because humans will compete over anything.
Jumpstyle later evolved into Hardstyle (which is just Jumpstyle with screaming Trance anthems), snuffing it out for awhile but Jumpstyle returned in the later 2000s after Hardstyle went full Dutch, which is a sin against nature more unforgiveable than the platipus.
I don't blame the Belgians for trying to get as far away from The Netherlands as geographically possible. It must suck living beside them all the time.
Ish.


## UK Hardhouse
*aka:  Stupid House, Party House, Party Rock, Donk, Hard Bounce, Hard Bass* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in mid 90s

Take NRG and add off-beat bass stabs. That's basically the gist of UK Hardhouse -- NRG's annoying, retarded kid brother.
Not just any off-beat bass stab, but the "donk" off-beat bass stab. I'll explain what that is later, but I'll give credit to UK Hardhouse: It is a very unique bass sound. It's just a very dumb one ("put a banging dumb on it" is what I used to say).
There are a lot of other differences too: Crowd-cheering noises sheepishly stolen from Happy Hardcore, more rap samples and less "Let's Go!" samples, extended builds that last 32 bars or more (you have any idea how long that is? It's over a minute. A whole minute of ratatat snare rolls slowly increasing in volume and sometimes pitch. Yes, it's as idiotic as it sounds), and anthemic horn fanfares instead of hoovers. A lot of this dumb shit came from Anthem House and Eurotrance so you know it was destined to be stupid right out of the gate. This genre had no chance at all.
DJ Jean - The Launch (you know, that song you always hear at hockey games), while technically Anthem House, has its roots in UK Hardhouse. Some tracks are absolutely absurd, with over six builds in them (including the standard minute-long build). A friend of mine called this music Party Rock back in the day. He wasn't being sarcastic (and he predated LMFAO by over a decade in observing the public's appetite for brainless arms-in-the-air party music).
It has to be called UK Hardhouse because Hard House already exists and has existed in Chicago for quite some time and it has nothing to do with this. But much like their empire, the self-centred Brits think that when they discover something that's the first time anyone has ever done it.
Because they had a flag.
It is difficult to even call this genre "hard" in the first place because it's not. It's not even harder than NRG. The offbeat bass stabs give it a circus-like bouncey silliness -- OOMPAH OOMPAH OOMPAH OOMPAH -- like Polka music, to the extent that I called it Stupid House back in the day. That wasn't a criticism of the music, that was literally what it was. This music is supremely dumb and eye-gougingly superficial. I blame Tidy Trax.
Lisa Lashes demonstrating her impeccable DJ skills.
Hard Dance in general is a goofy scene full of chavs, jibtek warriors, and street urchins wearing bright orange jumpsuits, overalls, or cabbie hats with Adidas track pants all the time (like, that's all they wear. Even at home. Like they only have one set of clothes). But none of the genres captured the hearts and minds of chavs more than UK Hardhouse. It is truly their jam. And by chavs I mean wiggers. Or whatever northern England's idea of a wigger is.
This mindless music wore out its welcome by the early 2000s, but miraculously came back later in the decade rechristened as Donk music, after its infamous bass stab which sounds like someone hitting the inside of a polyvinyl chloride pipe with a lead tuning fork. And thanks to a super cool music video that I can't tell if they're taking the piss or not. I assume they are because Brit humor is sophisticated like that. Even chav Brit humor.

The callouts to the other genres are all wrong, though.
	

Donk music has since evolved into something called Hard Bounce or Hard Bass, which is an even stupider form of Donk preferred by broke-ass, Adidas-wearing, perpetually squatting, drunken slavic and Russian chavs.
Typical Hard Bass dating profile. The line's over there, ladies.
Music like this never goes away because there will always be a market for vacuous crap, and for people who are entertained by Jersey Shore and supermarket tabloids, there's always this: UK Hardhouse. Donk music. The white trash trailer park of electronic music.
Ish.


## NRG
*aka:  Nu NRG, Hard NRG, Dark NRG, Acid NRG, Jetfighter Techno* in the Hard Dance scene, emerged in mid 90s

NRG, the genre formerly known as Nu NRG (no relation to Hi NRG, and not to be confused with the group Nu NRG which doesn't make Nu NRG at all but rather shitty Eurotrance) is the only one of the 90s Nu genres (see: Nu Skool Breaks, Nu Style Gabber) to actually have the smarts to drop the 'Nu' after awhile.
Because after 20 years it's kind of silly to keep calling it that.
NRG was a spinoff of the UK's brand of German Trance (ie: Hard Acid Trance) and the man most responsible for turning it into NRG was probably Tony de Vit. He was easily the biggest and most dedicated DJ to this sound in the early period and he pushed it hard and worked relentlessly to make it a thing, but like Moses forbidden from seeing the Promised Land he sadly died just before the genre went meteoric.
Everyone who came after capitalized on Tony's hard work. If he knew what had became of his pet genre he'd be spinning in his grave so fast aliens would steal him to power their FTL drives.
NRG was somehow a less anthemic but more cheesy brand of turbo-charged post-Rave rave music with super compressed drum kicks giving it a loud and obstinate "THOK THOK THOK THOK" sound, perfect for bad sound engineers at parties because it's almost impossible to muddle the levels with the beat so prominent like that. That's all anyone could hear and cared about at parties anyway.
NRG keeps the spirit of Rave alive with the re-introduction of hoovers -- that loveable "what the?!" mystery patch discovered on the Roland Alpha Juno-1 synthesizer -- and along with military aliases like Captain Tinrib and Commander Tom, compelled me to call it Jetfighter Techno back in the day. Complete with 4th bar samples calling everybody to "Come on let's go!" or "Keep on moving!" or "Don't stop!", NRG was the genre of choice for the late 90s party urchin known as: The Jibtek Warrior.
The Jibtek Warrior: Ballcap or visor, hoodie, JNCO or equivalent khaki phat pants, sometimes swinging a pair of glowsticks, energetic dancing, and oh yeah: The pale emaciated complexion marked with open facial sores masquerading as acne. Jib is slang for meth.
The jibtek warrior had one dance that had different names in different cities: The frontal leg kick hop back and forth on the second of each beat, and the pigeon-pecking head on the off-beat bass stabs (think of a more manic Night At The Roxbury head bob). This was known, depending on where you lived, as "nordic-tracking", "Westcoast hop", "Vancouver bounce", "Aussie two step", or just "jibtekking". It dominated dance parties for ten years until the Millenials arrived with their "shuffling" nonsense. Don't do meth, kids.
Listening to NRG is like watching a Curb Your Enthusiasm marathon: At first it's laugh out loud funny, but there are diminishing returns the more you watch and it gets less funny until you realize there is something deeply disturbing going on with Larry David and you're just hoping the next person will throttle the asshole.
NRG is like that: It's fine for about 20 minutes, or maybe even an entire set. But NRG parties could go on for days, they did not let up ever, and the jibtek warriors would not stop dancing. Because they couldn't. It was either that or spend all day in the garage sorting bolts. Seriously kids: Don't do meth.
Since its heyday as the rave music of choice (it was either this, Big Beat or Eurotrance -- the late 90s was a shitty time to go to a rave), NRG has split into a number of subgenres, most notably a harder, faster variant appropriately named Hard NRG, and also Acid and Dark variants. But of all its various flavors, none dominated the dancefloor alongside of it more than its much stupider sister genre: UK Hardhouse.
Ish.

# Trance

## Tech Trance
*aka:  Techtrance, Techno-trance* in the Trance scene, emerged in late 90s

Tech Trance was the last attempt to maintain the purity of the Trance ethos.
In the backdrop of Progressive Trance's betrayal and Eurotrance's fucking clownshoes were the regular Trance aficionados enthusiasts connoisseurs doods distraught at the way things were heading. They wanted nothing to do with the obnoxious anthems infecting clubland and I don't blame them.
It wasn't just in Eurotrance either. Breaks, Drum n Bass, House, Europop, UK Garage, Hard Dance, even the Psy Trance scene all copied the breakdown-build-anthem pop template and ROCKSTAR DJ motif for cheap and easy massive festival money.
This new pop electronic music was rebranded Electronica and it infected television commercials, movie soundtracks, and shopping malls like a deadly virus. Electronic music charted on legitimate record charts and electronic music videos got regular airtime on music television channels back when music television channels played actual music videos.
For MTV it was Amp. For Muchmusic Canucks it was RU Receiving.
The only holdout to this mainstreamization was (ironically) Techno which stayed true to its Detroit roots and shunned anything Eurocheesy. So where was regular Trance to go? Balearic was too mellow and Psy was on a completely different trip. The solution was Techno.
It can be argued that Tech Trance has origins way back in the early 90s but it didn't start becoming a necessary thing until 1999 when it served itself up as the counterweight to pop Euro Disney Cheese. That happens sometimes: Genres that may have been around for a long time only obtain a definition when contrast with what they're not. There's a modal logic argument in there somewhere that I'm too lazy to work out. Trust me, it's there. I can prove it.
You can use modal logic to prove anything. See, here's Godel's proof of God.
Tech Trance was started by Sasha & Digweed -- just kidding, they disowned all Trance by this point and went on to invent Progressive instead. Tech Trance was really started by Oliver Lieb, a studio rat with dozens of aliases and over 30 years in the business who has charted an interesting career: He got his start making technoized EBM, moved on to Hard Acid Trance (his second most famous alias), flirted with early Goa Trance and Gabber, briefly contributed to the emerging genre of German Trance, and of course made regular Trance and Techno.
But none of that compares to his Progressive Trance releases (his most famous alias), which I'm convinced he doesn't really like and just does for the fuck you money. This is a huge digression and a really abbreviated summary of the first decade of Oliver Lieb's career. But it also shows you how much these prolific producers actually care about genrefication (which is not at all).
Germany had its fill of stupid anthems with German Trance, and it seemed like it had gotten sick of them by the time they were exported to the UK and the Netherlands. This left a vacuum that was quickly filled by Techno (and then later on Minimal Techno, and then Minimal Minimal Techno, and then Min). 
What Tech Trance should have been is a genre based entirely off making music that sounds like Breeder - The Chain (the last of the really great Tech Trance tracks). But instead Tech Trance morphed into something of a Progressive Trance mk II with Hard Trance style (not to be confused with Hardstyle) booming bass kicks. This happened in the UK as well but not The Netherlands because Dutch Tech Trance is ass (except for this guy. he cool).
Tech Trance today probably sounds indistinguishable from Hard Trance (if Hard Trance is even still a thing). There is the odd throwback track here and there but if your intention is to make Progressive Trance instead you're better off sticking with that.
Ish.


## Progressive Trance
*aka:  Progressive House* in the Trance scene, emerged in mid 90s

Progressive Trance was the UK's take on Trance.
Of course it's called "Progressive" Trance because the UK is the only country that calls genres "Progressive" (cf. Progressive House, Progressive Breaks, Progressive Prog).
The idea was to do things to Trance that had not been done before: Extended breakdowns, chord progressions, vocals, crescendos, organic instruments -- you know, Progressive House things. The two genres somewhat blurred into one indistinguishable "UK club music" sound by 1997 and people stopped caring about which was which (especially since the DJs didn't care and freely played both).
As a workable extension of the Trance palette, Progressive Trance is not a bad idea and I quite like most of it. But that doesn't excuse it from being responsible for the most unforgivable sin in electronic music: The banal cult of DJ worship. That all started here, with this genre in the UK in the late 90s.
Most bigname DJs in general are whores but in Progressive Trance's case they were frauds as well.
On my old site I had a perpetual "coming soon" section of a forthcoming Guide to Brit DJs that was never completed (everyone from Dave Seaman to Matt Darey, Tall Paul, Judge Jules, Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Sasha & Digweed, Nick Warren, etc.). I probably won't resurrect it because there are far worse things in electronic music than Brit DJs now (like Dutch DJs) and they're all super old, but let me dust off some old notes on one particular case study and my #1 favorite punching bag: Paul Oakenfold. The Rob Liefeld of DJs.
I sold T-shirts of this on Cafepress back in the day.If you're wondering why I hate him so much, it's because I've seen him three times and he has horrendously trainwrecked every single time. It's like watching the world's #1 darts player have trouble hitting the board.
First a preamble: After the Criminal Justice Act of 1994 that effectively made raves illegal in the UK (well, they were already illegal but now the illegality was being enforced), corporate suits saw a commercial opportunity and turned a lawless outdoor recreational phenomenon into a heavily regulated indoor safe and boring commodity dominated by super dumb megaclubs and super dork megaDJs. 
The music that came to define this new corporate era of commercial idolatry was akin to wallpaper paste: Bland, inoffensive, and containing all the accessible things from the pop world of album-oriented frontman-centric marketing that 8-year-olds and grandmothers can really juke to: Big shiny hooks, uplifting chord progressions, a verse-bridge-chorus structure (sometimes with vocals), and of course a pretense at being cutting edge and undergound.
It's like putting a gift shop on top of Mt. Everest: Trivializing a once adventurous feat of personal growth and enlightenment into a meaningless purchased commodity. Participants of a once vibrant community reduced to mindless consumers like livestock. Or Caribbean tourists.
It took all of three years for Trance music to go from a relatively faceless genre in forests and farmers fields to this:
Somewhere Simon Berry is hurling things at people.
Selling the motif of the DJ -- a guy who plays other people's music for a living -- as some sort of Superstar Rock God with mysterious kung fu music skills honed through years of practice and discipline (or maybe just a few weeks fucking around with a pair of Tech-12s, a mixer, and some records) is easy to do when the world tour is backed by Benson & Hedges and the marketing campaign is backed by Napster. Let me explain:
File-sharing was not a new phenomenon in the 90s. People had been trading music via private FTP servers for as long as there was an internet. But being part of these collectives and knowing how to run an FTP server was a minor technical hurdle that closed off the seedy world of file sharing to the general body of humanity who barely knew how to operate their email (and to a large degree still don't).
Then Napster arrived which was really just a glorified GUI for an open-FTP. Like Apple's business model it broke down the technical barriers to entry and made something once relatively geeky bare-bones easy for the rest of the stupid majority to enjoy.
Taking a cue from the pop world, electronic music marketers discovered that something sells better if a face/name/image/style was attached to it. People don't really buy music based on its merits. They buy brands based on the personality of the artist (the last 10 years of Kanye West's musical output is a testament to this).
So nameless compilation/mix CDs that once had simple throwaway titles like "Trancendental Explorations Vol. 4" and no DJ credit were suddenly given the sleek marketing gloss of a pop idol embarking on a world tour. These weren't miscellaneous dime-a-dozen compilations, these were serious artist albums featuring someone important. It wasn't just Tranceport. It was "PAUL OAKENFOLD: Tranceport".
As compilation mixes go this is one of the most godawful mixes ever put to disc. 11 Progressive Trance and Eurotrance megahits lazily stitched together with the 16-bar end pieces over 77 minutes (do the math: That's 30 seconds of actual work every 7+ minutes). But hey, because they were chart toppers that makes Oakenfold a good DJ or something. For doing something robots can do. Hell, there were Winamp auto-mix plugins back then that could do this.
Thanks to Napster people were downloading Oakenfold's mixes thinking he was the brains behind the music. Every song on Tranceport was on Napster erroneously called a Paul Oakenfold track from his original artist CD Tranceport. And that he owned them and only he played them, so if you liked these tracks you could only hear them played live at an Oakenfold set concert.
Oakenfold's infamy reached Level Khloe on the Kardashian scale and he became the first Trance superstar. For a decade afterward I kept getting into arguments with angry kids trying to correct me that Gamemaster was by Oakenfold, and Binary Finary was by Paul van Dyk.
(And don't even get me started on that scam artist DJ Mystik)
None of this was Oakenfold's fault, of course, but if the guy wants to be the #1 DJ in the world he should at least try to mix like one. But he wasn't the biggest nor the last because just around the corner was Tiesto. And then there was Armin. And then Hardwell. You can see a downward spiral into a vortex of suck that I call Euro Disney Cheese aka Eurotrance -- a bombastic bastardization of Trance that's so offensive it's not even anywhere near Trance on this guide. It is literally the exact opposite.
In all honesty worshipping DJs is like giving a guy channel-surfing on his TV unending adulation for the original premise of The Simpsons. If you think your favorite DJ's placement on some sort of list validates your opinion of him then you probably need help buttoning yourself in the morning.
As for Progressive Trance, there were attempts to save it first with Tech Trance and then ten years later with Neo Trance but all were in vain.
Trance today sits defeated, a victim of the gross success of the Jesus Christ-posing egos who ground it underneath their heels into a thin, contextless paste, and then scooped it up, bottled it and sold it in a shiny plastic case for $24.95.
Ish.


## Neo Trance
*aka:  Minimal Trance, Neotrance, Neo-Trance, Nu Trance* in the Trance scene, emerged in mid 00s

Don't let the name fool you: Neo Trance is not an attempt to return Trance to its roots. It may be an attempt to do something new with Trance (hence the name), but it hasn't worked out so well.
Like leftover cocaine Neo Trance doesn't really exist. It's more of a trendwhore genre riding the Minimal bandwagon of the 2000s that those Germans love so much. But they couldn't call it Minimal Trance because there already was a Minimal Tech and a Minimal Techno and a Minimal Prog and a Minimal Maximal -- the world did not need yet another Minimal genre. Limited marketshare and all that.
So they called it Neo Trance instead which might be solely due to this compilation which, like most compilations, doesn't actually contain anything that would be classified as Neo Trance. You could also blame Kompakt though I wouldn't because that's a Tech House label and I don't care if some of its productions sound "trancey".
Compilations in general are always horrendously named and full of marketing jargon but no scene is worse at it than Trance. Occasionally a marketer will try to squeeze in a new buzzword by calling their mix series Cybertrance or Deep Trance, and if the mixes sell and people like them the music starts adopting the name of the mix series.
That's not a fucking thing.(Orphee is a French Goa DJ so I know this is actually Psy Trance but that's because I know everything. How is someone new to the scene supposed to know what it is?)
This is how we got terms like Angelic Trance and Epic Trance and Melodic Trance and Uplifting Trance -- three marketing buzzwords that became genres that refer to the same Euroweenie music.
Because Trance is dominated by its compilations and megastar DJs, nothing matters more than marketing -- of the buzzwords on the CD packet and the DJ's ranking on the DJ Mag Top 100, an electronic music popularity contest that only trancecrackers care about.
Should this genre exist? Probably not. After all, if someone is going to make Minimal Trance, why not just call it Trance? But at the same time, I'd be pressed on where to fit The Field and Peter Dundov's looping melodic arps anyway. It's like they want to make Trance but they are afraid of the word, it being associated with whatever explosive diarrhea the Dutch have sharted all over electronic music.
But Trance needs something to resuscitate its fallen name and Neo Trance may be its last best hope. So even though this music probably makes more sense hanging out in the Tech House and Techno scenes, it is here to remind Trance what is supposed to be real Trance: Hypnotic journeys, repetitive melodies, steady rhythms, and the long, evolving build to a peak crescendo (not an anthem).
One of Trance's most ancient names was in fact "Progressive Techno", a term that thankfully never stuck. For the here and now, however, Neo Trance will have to suffice.
Ish.


## Trance
*aka:  Trance* in the Trance scene, emerged in early 90s

Trance is the second most misattributed genre in all of electronic music (after Techno). If I asked you to give me a list of the best Trance DJs, all of them would be wrong. Because 1) You shouldn't have a concept of "best Trance DJs" and 2) Unless you have a copy of Harthouse or Eye Q's early catalogue on vinyl you probably don't know any actual Trance DJs. You probably don't know what Trance is either.
So what, exactly, is Trance and where did it come from?
As direct as I can put it: Trance was an offshoot of German EBM in the late 80s and early 90s and was probably coined in 1991 by Mark Reeder of MFS Records (although the word had been bandied about for several years before then). And we know this because he tells us as such in this 1993 documentary about the early Trance scene:

That first literal needle drop is Secret Knowledge - Sugar Daddy -- a "fine example of trance music".
	

Trance proper is a term that only applies to this short-lived style of music in Germany and the UK (and to a lesser extent the US) before it got ripped apart and pulled in different directions for different reasons, mangling its reputation beyond recognition. And that is all Trance should refer to and nothing else.
The principle behind Trance was the unresolved, infinite track, with interweaving elements and layers and a ceaseless beat carrying it along like a metronome.
Like a lot of early electronic music (and like all good electronic music), Trance borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of Minimalism and it disdained the usage of the dull verse-bridge-chorus format of pop songcraft. In the hands of a competent DJ Trance sounds like one long song, unceasing and unwavering, all night long. A single arpeggiating synth lead with phaser sweeps is all it really needs.
That's not to say that Trance does not have hooks or melodies, or even anthems of the next-day-washing-the-dishes-whistling-to-yourself variety, or that it should not have breakdowns. They're just not supposed to dominate Trance to an insufferable extent.
Trance is best when it lives up to its namesake: It entrances you. Anything else it tries to do (like make you cheer on the douche jockey or put your arms in the air) is fucking offensive.
Unfortunately there is a common tendency among critics and historians to find a number of similar attributes in a specific media, group them into a genre, and then go back in time and retcon other things with those attributes as the same genre despite the fact that the people in those eras did not and would not have called it that.
This happens a lot in things like books and movies (for instance: the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope coined in 2007 and then retconned to include Audrey Hepburn movies from 50 years ago) and it also happens in music.
And in electronic music's case it has happened most often with Trance.
There are a lot of things in the past that have been called proto-Trance or indicated as having a great influence on Trance, from Giorgio Moroder's galloping synths to the electric body buzz of Liaisons Dangereuses to the experimental minimalism of Pink Floyd - On The Run to even some Trance forerunners like Psychic TV or The KLF. But none of those are really Trance.
There is also a tendency among music magazines and fans to continuously call something that someone made Trance because they previously made Trance even though it's clearly evident that they have long since moved on from the sound and have no interest in returning to it, like Ferry Corsten's Electrohouse dumbassery, or whatever stupid shit Armin is trying to do, or Tiesto's pitiful attempts at trying to make Trouse happen. But none of those are really Trance either.
This is also why you should stop following these dipshits like they're rock stars. Listen to Trance because you like Trance, not because you hero worship Dutch superdorks.
And then there are the watered down pop offshoots of Trance (including Eurotrance and Vocal Trance) that you often hear in clothing stores at the mall. None of that is Trance either. That's not what this genre is. Ferry, Armin, and Tiesto are not here.

Listen to what real Trance should sound like.
	

Trance as a concept was so fragile it obviously could not and did not last. As with most things in electronic music, things go to shit when the Dutch get hold of it. The descendents of Trance -- Progressive Trance, Hard Dance, Psy Trance, Eurotrance -- all sold it down the river in their own unique way.
When I think of pure Trance music, I really don't think of anything past 1994. There are some exceptions but generally all Trance music has been commercial pop drivel since the late 90s. I blame Oakenfold.
Ish.


## Balearic Trance
*aka:  Belearic House, Balearic Beat, Balearic Music, Ibiza Trance* in the Trance scene, emerged in early 90s

Balearic Trance is not a genre. It is a feeling. A mood. A state of mind. A blissful memory of certain days gone by in a certain place at a certain time. A memory that can never be recaptured. It is Yacht Rock for the electronic set.
Balearic Trance (not a genre) came from Balearic Beat (also not a genre), in that it was just a term for music played in Ibiza in the late 80s and early 90s by DJs like Jose Padilla at Cafe Del Mar and Alfredo Fiorito at Amnesia.
This could've been anything from African Funk to Latin Soul to Hip Hop, Jazz, Lounge, Disco, Mediterranean Pop, Indie Rock, Bossa Nova, Salsa, New Beat, Italian Deep House, you name it. It was an undefinable half-electronic potpourri of blended 80s fusion genres delivered at a slower tempo for sleepy tourists eager to get their whatever-the-Spanish-equivalent-of-Jimmy-Buffett-is on.
So while Balearic music didn't have a definite sound, it did have a definite personality. It preserved a laidback everyone-is-your-best-friend beachbum vibe, and DJs deliberately selected dreamy downtempo songs from a vast range of existing genres to best capture that elusive vibe, with some nods to Iberian culture and history for flavor.
A typical Balearic music compilation cover.
And then ecstasy hit the islands and suddenly everyone convinced themselves that there was something bigger and more important going on in this tiny enclave than just a bunch of obnoxious Brit tourists hopped up on goofballs hearing Acid House for the first time.
Struck with a burning desire to share their experiences with the rest of the world, these lucky bastards went back to England to start their own Balearic parties but unfortunately all they retained from Ibiza was 1) Acid House music and 2) Ecstasy. Which is just as well because marketing the Mediterranean experience to dreary rain-soaked bog-infested Britain would have been a tough sell anyway.
After raves and clubs exploded Balearic music got more electronic and beat-heavy, probably because of Jam & Spoon - Stella, regarded as the first Balearic hit that gave the genre its neo-christening of "Balearic Trance". That doesn't necessarily make Balearic a trendwhore genre when it's not going out of its way to sound like the most popular genres. It has a vibe and it will stick by this vibe irrespective of its popularity.
(nevermind what's being played on the islands now. That's not Balearic music)
A key defining feature of Balearic music is organic instrumentation like Spanish guitars, mandolins, congas, panflutes, pianos, orchestral strings, and also the natural sounds of the Balearic islands like waves crashing, seagulls squawking, and a soft mellow breeze blowing off the ocean. It can inject these instruments into any sound (it doesn't have to be Trance), but the most common targets are Trance, House, Downtempo, and most recently Tropical House. So long as it's got those Mediterranean indicators it's all Balearic and it's all good.
Also a typical Balearic music compilation cover.
Of course, today the Balearic scene isn't like that anymore. The beach vibe has been replaced by tacky tourist traps and omnipresent commercial uniformity. The keen talent has been replaced by bloated coked out self-absorbed mega DJs spinning monotonous Tech House sets in super clubs designed to vacuum money out of your wallet. Compilations litter the music stores promising you buzzwords in lieu of content. And sleazy celebrity DJs cane shitty top40 remixes in overpriced meat lockers masquerading as dance clubs. And rich trust fund brats have driven up the cost of everything. And there's nowhere to park.
Ibiza hasn't been a decent party destination in over 20 years. It's like Yogi Berra said: "No one goes there anymore -- it's too crowded."
Ish.


## Dream Trance
*aka:  Dream House, Dream Dance* in the Trance scene, emerged in early 90s

Dream Trance is the cilantro of electronic music: Some people will like it while other people will complain that it tastes like a minty bar of soap.
It is a very rigid genre with very specific criteria and hardly any deviation: 4-to-the-floor kick pitched up Eurodance style, off-beat bass stabs and minor key progressions, light acid and/or arpeggios of some sort, airy uplifting strings, occasional vocals, and oh yeah: The piano. Always that piano -- that lovely candlelight piano melody that, if played alone, evokes images of staring out the window of an empty cafe onto rainy washed out streets after a bitter breakup.
Dream Trance works best mixed with Balearic music because it's really hard to consume a whole night or even a whole set of this stuff. It has an extremely limited palette that gets tiresome quickly. But it was a thing in Italy for the better part of a decade and you have to hand it to the Italians for milking this specific sound for all it's worth.
You're probably waiting for me to bring up the late great Robert Miles. While he is to Dream Trance what Scrooge McDuck is to money, the truth is he did not come up with Dream Trance and the original version of Children is a Balearic track with a Spanish guitar and no piano. But oh man -- that Dream Version. The definition of underground hit, an iconic melody so famous your grandmother has probably heard of it.
The way the story goes: Miles was inspired to produce the track after a number of fatal accidents hit the Italian rave scene in the early 90s. Partykids were falling asleep at the wheel and crashing their vehicles on the way home after partying, and the track was intended to be more of a closer for DJ sets at the end of parties rather than a caution or a warning or even a scold. The party scene likes to police itself and the message was loud and clear: Slow the fuck down and party responsibly.
Of course he followed it up with an album of same-sounding songs, all of them made with the same presets on his Kurzweil K2000. Probably knocked them out in a lazy Sunday afternoon.
Do you like Children? Here are eight other songs that sound exactly like it.
Normally this is the part where I tell you the most popular songs in this genre are not the best ones and that there are some real good oft-overlooked underground gems. Not the case with Dream Trance. Children is the alpha and omega of whatever it is you're looking for here. There is really nothing else. No stone to uncover, no secret label to dig up like buried treasure. This is a one hit wonder genre. Searching for better Dream Trance than Children is as pointless as pillows in a coffin.
Children is still with us. It is still being released on "Chill Out Classics" and "Ibiza Anthems" and "Pure Trance Megahits!" compilations today (If Discogs is to be believed, the current tally is over 1170. That's one thousand one hundred seventy compilations or mixes with some version of Children on them). And lip-chewing producers with no sense of decency are still churning out trendwhore remixes. It's like The Beatles music -- it will never go away.
As for Dream Trance, it wore out its welcome by the end of the decade and its strict ruleset didn't allow for any evolution or descendents. Some upped the tempo, some replaced the piano with pizzicato strings, but that wasn't really evolution so much as variations on a theme.
Ish.

# Psy Trance

## Progpsy
*aka:  Progressive Psy Trance, Psyprog, Psygressive, Dark Progressive, Zenonesque, Minimal Psy, Psytek, Psy Tech, Tribal Psy, Ethnic Psy, Psychedelic Techno, Offbeat Psy, Psystep, PsyDM* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in early 00s

Progpsy (or Psy Prog, take your pick): Because some Psy just doesn't fit with other Psy.
I won't say that Progpsy has anything to do with Progressive House or Progressive Trance or Progressive Breaks or even Progressive, but it does make an attempt to capture the spirit of them. By that I mean not the actual sound but rather the tendency to be more mature and intellectual (read: pretentious), following in the grand ethos of Progressive Rock.
Where Full On emphasizes the lead anthems and Darkpsy emphasizes the pummelling minimalist basslines, Prog Psy emphasizes subdued rhythms, layered textures, and melodies that try not to get too squirrelly even though most Progressive variants see squirrelly melodies as an advancement of their craft. But in Psy's case it's a detriment since every genre does it. That's progressive music for you: Always trying to be different for the sake of being different.
Because of its subdued and understated nature, Prog Psy is considered less busy and more minimalist than other Psy Trance genres (an early name for it was Minimal Psy). It could almost pass off as regular Trance (the non cheesy kind) and its crossover appeal has not been overlooked by most Trance/Psy hybrid DJs. You can even make an argument that Progpsy exists because Progressive Trance does. But to be perfectly honest, just about any Psy track can sound like Progpsy if you play it at 120 bpm instead of 145.
Progpsy virtuoso about to embark on a noodly 16 hour psychedelic freakout.
When you do as many drugs as Psy Trance hippies your brain tends to go into OCD overdrive, seeing patterns and connections (and sometimes conspiracy theories) in everything from art to language to politics and even music. It is for this reason that Psy Trance is one of the most overclassified and anal-retentively scrutinized scenes in electronic music.
There are guides to Psytrance on the Internet that I can't even hope to compete with. They are worth a browse-through if you are seriously interested in understanding this music to the point of obsessive hand-washing thanks to immense doses of 2-CB. Can you find any exhaustive categorizations between Garage, Dark Garage, Deep Dark Garage, and Deep Dark Garagetech? No, because Garage doesn't care about mind-melting minutiae bullshit like that.
So if you think Full On and Darkpsy had too many subgenres, here comes Progpsy which has the most subgenres of all. In addition to its Hard and Dark variants it also has Tribal and Ethnic variants that like using djembes and didgeridoos, Breaks and Drum n Bass variants (although when Psy Trance uses the DnB two-step kick it sounds indistinguishable from Neurofunk), Zenonesque which is really just a label from Australia, and also Psytek or Psytekk or Psy Tech or Psytech or Techpsy or whatever you want to call it, which was a thing about 20 years ago but now there is something new called "Psy Techno" which bares no resemblance to the thing 20 years ago and is probably called that now because people didn't know there used to be something else called that. I don't blame you for feeling bewildered by all this.
Do you have to know the difference between all these genres? Not unless you do copious amounts of drugs, in which case the differences will be clearly obvious to you. I mean, if that's what you really want.
Ish.


## Full On
*aka:  Fullon Psy, Full-On, Uplifting Psy, Anthem Psy, Morning Psy, Twilight Psy, Night Psy, Peak Hour Psy, Its-2am-I'm-coming-down-I-need-another-bump Psy, Israeli Psy* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in late 90s

Full On is Psychedelic Trance trying to sound like Eurotrance (but in a Psy sort of way), which makes it the most accessible. It was the most popular Psy Trance genre in the days when Eurotrance was the most popular of everything (but notsomuch anymore). If you're just getting into Psy Trance, this is the first genre you'll probably like. Especially if you're coming from Eurotrance.
As Psychedelic Trance shed the first molt of its Goa skin, its descendents shit-canned the crazy Indian scales and adopted a colder, more metallic and cybernetic posture with circuit bending mindfuckery that sounds like Robocop and The Terminator having sex inside the computer from Superman III.
Full On took this template and added singalong anthems and bassline chord progressions which is something Psy Trance just hadn't really done before (well, except for the odd exception).
It was inevitable that something like this would show up. Eurotrance had taken over everything so Psy Trance thought it might take a stab at some of that super mega stadium festival fuck you money too. And it knew the perfect place to do it: Israel, the halfway point between northern Europe and Goa, pooling influences from both cultures like the legendary bedouin merchants of yore.
So instead of being a dystopian cybernetic hellscape journey through the lucid dreaming meditation altered state wankathon the way Psychedelic Trance envisioned, Full On is more like a smiling happy optimistic HR Giger future full of sunshine and kumbaya, with less penis-shaped pipes slithering out of orifices and more copper circuitry routing meaningless data spiritual enlightenment through your brain at the speed of light because Psy Trance is never actually dour or depressing even though the music sometimes sounds like it.
In fact, one would assume given the content that Psy Trance enthusiasts are ready to "abandon the meat" and live forever as a living consiousness in some utopian non-material form of existence like the Human Instrumentality Project in Evangelion or the Overmind in Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End (or, umm, you know.... that movie).
Now here's the real solipsist puzzler: What if we have already done that? What if the reality you're experiencing right now is the simulation? And how can you tell? It is possible that life itself is just one big fabrication and any day now the scaffolding holding up the world is going to fall and Morpheus will come out and explain to us that we're really a wizard descended from nobility stuck in a television show the whole time.But at the same time how can you know that any of that is true (or not true)? Any attempt to use reasoning to verify your reasoning is an axiomatic fallacy. You aren't challenging your base assumptions. That's the problem with epistemology: Munchausen's trilemma and all that. The real way to defeat solipsism is to declare it irrelevent. Existence behaves exactly the same whether solipsism is true or not which makes it a rather useless thing to believe in, like a god who lives outside time and space and doesn't interact with the universe. What's the point of believing in a god like that?*slurps mad bong rips*

But the one consistant thing was Psy Trance's signature contribution to electronic music: The rolling bassline (not to be confused with the Drum n Bass "Reese" rolling bassline that is a completely different sound), created with three bass 16th notes with some cutoff following each kick. Deadly simply stuff.
And where previous incarnations tend to meander about with layers of noodly synths, Full On was straight up driving trance. You might say it was up front and forward about it. Like it was completely committed to its sound with no deviation or distractions. Psy Trance with some discipline (rare in a scene as scattershot as this one).
It may have gotten the name from this series (unless it didn't) but it already adopted the descriptor "Uplifting Psy" (stolen shamelessly from Uplifting Trance) and by the time the music settled into a definable genre it had split into countless derivatives because no one is more anal-retentive about the divisions in their scene than Psy Trance hippies. I blame long-lasting drugs that spark creativity and a heightened sense of pattern recognition mixed with too much time on your hands.
Taking a page from Eurotrance, certain substyles of Full On took on the mantle of "Peak Hour Psy", as in the highest point of the night when you're high so the music should be high to make the highs higher than the highest highs.
Due to the success of Peak Hour other Full On styles were quickly sorted into the remaining parts of the night: Morning Psy, Night Psy, Twilight Psy (A South African variant that exists quite possibly because of this album), Its-2am-I'm-coming-down-I-need-another-bump Psy, and the sketchy-antisocial-afterparty Psy.
Full On Psy continues to this day as the gateway genre to Psy Trance for most people. But like Eurotrance the formula grows tiresome, and those seeking something else may move onto the forbidding recesses of Darkpsy or the intellectual enlightenment of Progpsy. 

But for those who just want to flail about as the drugs are kicking in, Full On will always be there.
Ish.



## Darkpsy
*aka:  Dark Psy, Dark Psytrance, Forest Psy, Swamp Psy, Terror Trance, Cyberdelic, Alien Psy, Hi-Tech, Hitek Psy, Psycore* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in early 00s

If Psychedelic Trance is the dark sequel to Goa Trance then Darkpsy is the dark sequel to Psychedelic Trance. Or so the progression goes.
You can count on every scene to have its own token Deep (as in groove), Dark (as in evil), Hard (as in loud), or Chill (as in slow) genres. The Dark genre is always what happens when the scene studies under a Sith Lord for a few lessons. Darkpsy is Psy Trance's contribution to the trend.
It was probably started by Xenomorph (unless it was X-Dream), who introduced themes of the occult, night terrors, bad acid trips, demonic symbols and iconography, haunting hallucinations and harrowing HP Lovecraft hellspawns, and anything else spooky and weird to the Psy Trance canon.
As to why such a ghastly genre came about at all, one possible theory is the 2000 arrest of LSD manufacturer William Leonard Pickard, whom supposedly was responsible for 95% of all acid trips in the country at the time (and who knows how much around the world). For a few years it was really hard to find good acid which contributed to colder Psy Trance parties with more meth and less psychedelics. I don't buy it, but it is a theory.
Whereas Psychedelic Trance and Full On at least had chord progressions, Dark Psy stubbornly doesn't. In fact, the lead synth (if there is one) is often just as basic and minimal as the 3-note bassline. And this is what you listen to all. night. long. The CIA probably uses this as a torture advanced interrogation technique.
Over time Darkpsy picked up a number of subgenres and styles, mostly sorted by the quality, density, and type of creepy sound effects and samples stuffed into each track. Babies crying, gremlins cackling, demons dancing, cyborgs bitcrushing, cenobites snoring, xenomorphs fucking -- nothing was too weird for Darkpsy.
It was almost a challenge to see what weird, warped, twisted, messed up, whacked out, random sonic gibberish it could get away with, which was technically anything. This isn't music for maximizing your high, this is music for sketching you out afterward. If you last that long. Like Mr. Bones says: "The ride never ends."
Much like how Full On has substyles labeled after specific moments of the night, Darkpsy has substyles labeled after specific locations. Chief among these is Forest Psy, which originally started out as a somewhat melodic Psy Trance subgenre but got darker over time (you might say with alarmingly fast overgrowth, like that Creepshow episode "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill" with the plants that grow on everything, even human skin) until Darkpsy took case ownership of it.
Forest Psy conjures up images of a dank, mossy forest with a thick canopy that covers all sunlight. In the distance there are cackling gnomes and pixies but due to the reverberating thickness of the forest you are unable to tell from which direction they're coming. There are glowing malevolent eyes peeking from between tree branches, and every night the spongey moss-covered forest floor comes literally alive with countless hungry critters eager to take a piece of human home with them.
Anyone who tells you forests are peaceful companions of man and nature is lying. Forests are evil harbingers of  misery that smother the Earth in putrid biomass. They must be culled so the Earth can breathe!
If Darkpsy is dark, then Forest Psy is pitch dark. And if that's not dark enough for you, an even darker subgenre of Forest has emerged called Swamp. You do not want to know what goes on underneath the thin layer of scum on the surface.
In the late 00s Darkpsy got faster, giving us the 180 bpm style Hi-tech which borrows from IDM/Glitch, and then there's Psycore, a 200+ bpm style that is so fast it might as well be Speedcore.
It's not important that you know the difference between these styles because they only matter to the Psy Trance community.
And they have way too much time on their hands.
Ish.



## Psychedelic Trance
*aka:  Uptempo Psy, UK Psy, Melodic Psytrance, Dark Psytrance, Suomisaundi* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in late 90s

Psychedelic Trance is what Goa Trance sounds like when you remove the Goa.
It took all of two generations of producers (3-5 years, give or take) before some keeners realized that Goa Trance was being made for, and celebrated by, people who not only had never been to Goa but had zero interest in going there and even less interest in truly grokking the subculture at a pertinent mystical level. You know, by transcendentally expanding the universe of human potentialities that alters the immaterial plane and extends the ego to the outer reaches of the cosmos via the woo woo train.
The physical world is the foundation of exponential human observation.
Some liked the music. Some liked the art. Some just liked the drugs. In fact, most just liked the drugs. And some didn't care for Indian scales or multiple octive-spanning melodies, or even chai tea or tai chi. They wanted Psy Trance to give them that blitzed-out feeling that only hardcore psychedelic inebriants and staring at kaleidescopic fractal art can bring.
So the music over time got faster, trippier, more intense and less spiritual (whatever that means). Out were the weird George Harrison affectations and in were the dense layers of squiggly noodly synth lines, what the old Goa guard called the "random wibble". Unless I'm making that up.
It's kind of a logical progression. Every industry identifies the thing the customer wants and then makes more of that specific thing. Like how the porn industry recognized in the 80s that people only watched it for the sex and fast-forwarded through the plot so by the 90s porn stopped having plots and just filmed sex scenes.
This is also what happened to Psy Trance: Its customers really loved psychedelic drugs so they made music that was more drug-centric and less cosmic awareness uplifting through the transcendental plane of existence through the third eye of dharma or some shit. Not to say that all Psy Trance lovers were like that. But most were.
It also helped that two new pieces of virtual analog equipment came out that helped Goa transmogrify into Psy. The first was Clavia's Nord Lead 1 released in 1995:
What a Nord Lead 1 might look like.
The other was the Access Virus in 1997:
What a Virus might look like.
The Nord Lead 1 was nicknamed "The Screamer" while the Virus was nicknamed "The Mutant" (taking the name away from the TB-303 which held it previously). You can probably guess what kind of sounds they contributed to the Psy Trance family.
That's not to say making Psy Trance was hard before these beasts were released. There was still the SH-101 "Red Devil" and Juno 106 "Fuck Oberheim" and a dozen other synths to mess around with. But these two synths in particular really locked in all Psy producers into a signature sound. So if you're wondering why all Psy started to sound the same after about 97, this is why. Same equipment; same presets; same arrangements.
So for the rest of the 90s you had two competing schools of thought: The Goa "religious awakening of the inner consciousness blah blah blah" music, and the Psy "let's get fucked up" music. In the end Psy won because of course it did. Ain't nobody got time to read about the eightfold path of enlightenment but hey, this 2C-G-5 lasts up to 48 hours (not making that up. Shulgin himself mentions it in PIHKAL).
Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved, the Farmer's Almanac of designer psychoactive substances. As voracious drug consumers hippies are by far the most knowledgeable drug experts on the planet. If you don't know what you're on, ask a hippie. They can talk you through drugs like a College basketball freak explaining his March Madness bracket.
As Psychedelic Trance is technically the baseline genre for the whole scene, it has spawned the most number of subgenres. Chief among these is its flirtations with Trance including Psy Tech-Trance, Psy-Techno, Tech Psy and Psytekk which Psy Trance lovers insist are completely separate things. There are also demarcations between "Melodic Psychedelic Trance" and "Dark Psychedelic Trance" but those are just descriptors that no DJ in his right mind gives a shit about.
There is also Suomisaundi (literally Finnish for "Finnish Sound"), a Finnish variant made by Fins that comes from Finland.
But probably the biggest Psychedelic Trance subgenre was Full On -- a name that was initially not meant to mean anything until it got super popular and spawned a dozen subgenres by itself. No one expected that to happen but when it did they couldn't change the name (well they could but only because the original name was Trancey McTranceface).
Psychedelic Trance also had a goofy component to it for awhile in the late 90s and early 00s. Samples of people sneezing or burping, babies hiccuping, telephone rings and of course buttrock guitar riffs (which I lovingly called Buttrock Goa at the time), all delivered tongue in cheek. Because you should never take Psy Trance too seriously.
If you're waiting for me to say something about Juno Reactor, Hallucinogen or Infected Mushroom, the truth is I find their music to be middle of the pack. I understand they are very popular and they were the introduction to the world of Psy Trance for a lot of people so they win a lot of hearts and minds through first impressions. But the scene is massive with thousands of labels and artists around the world, and I find their contributions to be very ignorable. They aren't a good representation of what's actually out there.
Balkanization of music is not a new thing, but due to the insular nature of Psy Trance (it's very much an all-or-nothing scene) it has become fiercely over-categorized, especially when it borrows ideas from other scenes to create countless hybrid genres like Minimal Psy, Pop Psy, Psybreaks, Psychill, Psystep, Electro Psy or Psy Hop. It's horrifying that you can't even tell if I'm making these genres up, can you?
So there is probably far more genres than I actually have listed here. Doesn't mean I have to care about any of it.
Ish.


## Goa Trance
*aka:  Psychedelic Trance, Psychedelic Goacore, Nitzhonot, Nitzhogoa, Newskool Goa, NeoGoa* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in early 90s

Welcome to the domain of the crusty hippies.
Ibiza wasn't the only vacation destination assaulted back in the 80s by annoying trust-fund Brit brats in tacky Hawaiian shorts looking for pills and powder to fuel their fabled coming-of-age tales. The other hotspot was Goa, India. There's a storied history behind this that's somewhat obscured by facts.
The beach parties were actually there first. You could probably blame The Beatles and their botched visit to the Maharishi for piquing western civilization's interest in cat-strangling sitar music and multi-armed deities while sweating their innards out, smoking hashish, and giggling and staring at a glowing Buddha effigy for several hours pretending they be getting consciousness expansion. But I digress.
So the infrastructure was already in place. Hippie travelers were dropping LSD and throwing non-stop music and dance parties that went on for days (because the drugs lasted so damn long) along the beaches of Goa since at least the 60s (specifically Anjuna Beach in North Goa. Yes, where Above & Beyond got the name).
At the time Psychedelic Rock and jam bands were the music of choice (Pink Floyd, The Grateful Dead and all that). But also spacey Krautrock dreamscape bands like Tangerine Dream and Ash Re Temple. You know, any pointless noodly music that lasts as long as the drugs.
In the 80s the House explosion reached India's western shores, specifically Acid House with its alien-sounding trippy synthlines that complimented psychedelic drugs like peanut butter and chocolate (and it's right there in the name). While a number of legendary Goa DJs will say they started the scene, the one who gave it that electronic edge was probably Goa Gil.
What Goa Gil might look like.
It was Goa Gil who brought Krautrock, Industrial and EBM to Goa because he felt the machine-perfect rhythms were essential for seeking the psychic transcendance of spiritual consciousness that expands the emotional imagination toward the waking dream state or whatever bullshit.
Unfortunately the extreme heat would melt vinyl so Goa DJs learned to make pre-mixed cassette and DAT tapes (see Goa Gil picture above -- those are DATs). They selected tracks that could take you on a special journey toward extending your psychokinetic torsion field negaverse cosmic energy crystal healing or some shit, in some cases editing out the vocals and just looping the deep arpeggiating baselines (a distinctive feature that persists in Psy Trance to this day).
In effect, it was the Goa DJs who invented Trance. But it was a bare-bones type of Trance born out of necessity -- stripped down heavily edited EBM with Acid lines. The use of pre-mixed DATs meant the DJs did not have to do much mixing (because have you ever tried mixing with tapes? I have. It's hard).
A DAT is a Digital Audio Tape, a superior format to the analog cassette tape that was the consumer format of choice in the 80s. It didn't catch on due to piracy concerns and because CDs were just around the corner anyway, but it was prized by studio producers and engineers for its hi-fidelity. It's still often used for mastering and recording today.
Thus begins the long-standing tradition in Psy Trance of poorly mixed DJ sets of very long tracks. In terms of commercial/club appeal Psy Trance music is the longest with the average track being 10+ minutes (with bridges, and sections, and movements), thus reducing the DJ's role in having to DJ.
Comparatively speaking, the Psy Trance DJ is the laziest DJ in electronic music but that's okay because he also has the most stamina. DJing is a marathon not a sprint in Psy Trance. It is not uncommon for sets to last 6-8 hours (Goa Gil himself once mixed for 36). But they're still only laying down a couple dozen tracks.
But like Ibiza, Goa is not where they made the music. They only made it when they came back to Europe. Each year they would cut new music, take the tapes to India, come back and make something else, and each year they pushed the sound further into its own thing. By the 90s this sound naturally developed Indian scales and influences from their adopted homeland. The only thing retained from EBM were the pummeling arpeggiating basslines and occasional sci-fi movie samples.
And the party scene looked like this:

Let's try to not make comparisons to whatever that bullshit was in The Matrix: Reloaded.Tracks are Cosmic Enterprises - Tao Nonstop and The Overlords - Sundown (Ionizer remix)


This sound wasn't actually codified into dedicated labels and artists until around 1993. Goa's golden age (93-99) was marked by increased experimentation and expansion of the spirital third eye of your inner self lifting up to the skygates and touching the gods in the butthole or who the fuck cares. Some made it slower and gave us Psydub, others made it faster and gave us Psychedelic Trance, and then even faster and harder to give us Darkpsy (you know, for those DMT trips).
While the music has changed a lot since then the parties themselves -- as well as the partiers -- have not. They still drink chai, they still wear tie-dye clothing, white guys still have dreadlocks, and they still have hygiene issues but that's just the way hippies roll and every Goa party I've ever been to always has that one guy staring way too long at this, struggling to understand what it all means:
It means you're fucking high.You want to ascend to a higher plane of existence? Try climbing a flight of stairs.
I should mention that there is probably no actual difference between "Goa Trance" and "Psychedelic Trance" just as there is no difference between Jungle and Drum n Bass. The name change occurred sometime toward the end of the 90s (only oldskoolers call it Goa Trance), but I submit that there is a sharper demarcation between the old Goa sound and the new Psy sound that makes a cleaner break than some of the arbitrary distinctions in other scenes.
For one: Goa Trance is absolutely in love with India and all the superficial Hindu art and iconography it can stuff into a rave. Also Indian scales, melodies, chants, and sometimes even instruments.
Psy Trance sought to do away with all that and while still very much psychedelic it divorced itself from its origins as healthy scenes sprang up around the world including:
Israel, giving us Israeli Trance or Nitzhonot which was a potential thing until Full On was invented, stealing its audience.
America, which was probably just Christopher Lawrence (sometimes) and whatever noisy nonsense is going on at Burning Man. And before you complain, understand that the hippies and the Psy Trance music were there first. You are the one who is the poseur tourist.
Australia, where they became known as "Doof" parties after the pillow-punching sound a slightly over-driven drumkick makes when you give it tons of sustain. Or anywhere it's hot and sunny. Psy Trance is hot summer weather music. No one goes Christmas carolling to this stuff.
With that said, Goa Trance as an extant genre is pretty much relegated as a distant 90s thing. There is a movement to revive it as "New School" or "NeoGoa" but its replacement for the most part is Psychedelic Trance and its successors.

A seamless tour through Goa Trance's roots. This probably has better mixing than any Goa mix you will ever find.
	

Goa Trance is Trance music at its purest essence, where psychedelia could run wild and free unfettered from the societal norms and bland commercial anthems that corrupted other Trance scenes. Here, and only here, could the unchained spirits of rave roam as they were wont to do. And it is good.
Ish.


## Psydub
*aka:  Ambient Psy, Ambient Goa, Psy Chill, Psy Dub, Psybient, Psychedelic Chillout, Downtempo Psy, Psy Breaks, Deep Trance* in the Psy Trance scene, emerged in early 90s

Psydub is what the crusty hippies listen to when they get tired of dancing. Or when the drugs wear off. Or when they choose horse tranquilizers instead of LSD.
Every scene has its chill room genre and Psy Dub arrived pretty quickly after Goa Trance established itself, with intentions to offset the busy acid lines, doofing drumkicks, and screaming melodies with something lowkey and non-expressive. Every artist album has one or two ballad songs for Prom season. In Psy Trance's case those songs were Psydub.
It has changed a lot over the years. An early name for it was Psybient (which is still in use for any Psydub that has no Dub in it), and it was a Psy Trance take on the emerging Chill Out sounds of Ambient House (ie: The KLF, The Orb and the like) -- simple breakbeats with mutant acid lines but slowed down so they're less squiggly wiggly and more squirmy whirmy. These are technical terms.
As Psydub is a different trip than other Psy Trance genres, it attracts a certain class of person: The cerebral hippie, who holds vast quantities of knowledge about life, biology, mathematics, quantum physics, computer programming, cosmology, human history, evolution, and whatever the hell Deepak Chopra is babbling about, except that half of it is bullshit and all of it is wrong.
Never get your science education from paranoid burnouts who think human evolution was seeded by black-eyed extraterrestrials who have recently returned only to slaughter cattle and probe our buttholes (although to be fair the data contained within our buttholes has the potential to advance galactic science by many years).
As time progressed Psydub came into its own as an excellent chill genre and if you're into this music I suppose you're just waiting for me to get to Shpongle. But the truth is Shpongle is like The Eagles of Psydub.
And we all know what burnt-out old hippies think of the fucking Eagles, man.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing Shpongle. I acknowledge the indelible impact they have made on Psydub music. And yes, every Psydub track for a decade afterward was heavily influenced by Are You Shpongled? although I just think it sounds like a less interesting, more effects-laden poor man's Orbital - In Sides. But with, like, Indian chants n shit. And that stupid dripping sound. The stupid dripping sound that defined Psydub (and a lot of Psy Trance) for the next decade.
Instead of Shpongle, I'd rather talk about music that's better than Shpongle, like one of my favorite labels: Ultimae Records. Although not strictly Psydub, the label that gave us Carbon Based Lifeforms, Aes Dana, Asura, and Solar fucking Fields is so ridiculously consistent (and by ridiculously consistent I mean consistently good) you wonder if it's not multiple labels pretending to be one.
Additionally, when you order music from them they send you not just a CD packed with liner notes but also posters, placards, stickers of their unique brand of art, incense sticks, and even handwritten letters thanking you. It doesn't even feel like you're buying music from a label but rather joining a special club.
I said club, not cult. Although with Psydub labels you never can tell.
Psydub is still around today and is stronger than ever, mostly because Dubstep gave it some dumb ideas ten years ago and Glitch Hop is giving it even dumber ideas today.
I suppose that would be considered trendwhoring but it's not like it took the scene completely by surprise. I don't blame Psydub for doing that. I blame the decline of LSD and the rise of Ketamine.
Because you can always blame the drugs.
Ish.

# Industrial/Goth

## EBM
*aka:  Electronic Body Music, Body Music, Electro-Industrial, Techno-Industrial, Industrial Dance, Synth-Industrial* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in early 80s

EBM stands for Electronic Body Music. It has no relation to that other acroynm that poseurs have been chewing like used bubblegum for the past decade. The name is allegedly attributed to Kraftwerk for reasons unknown as Kraftwerk did not make any.
EBM (sometimes just called Body music) is named for the electric body buzz sensation of the genre's high energy percolating machine percussions and arpeggiating bassline rhythms. While Industrial was about finding interesting sounds and making them musical, EBM was about finding interesting sounds and making them danceable. And not just any kind of dancing, but the kind of jackboot dancing that you normally see in armies on the march or angry political dissidents with raised fists in unison at Rage Against The Machine concerts.
While EBM did not invent arps, it gave them a gravelly dark grain, like the menacing buzz of an electrical transformer or low frequency feedback hum. More electric than electronic, EBM uses synthesizers to create harsh, muscular basslines and rhythms for angry punks who want a little telos in their lives.
And then there are the vocals, full of politically charged lyrics about totalitarian systems, oppressive social conformity, the execution of five year plans, or the decrepid machinery of post-industrial living, not sung but bellowed out like a drill sergent barking orders at fresh recruits on the first day of bootcamp.
I'm sure EBM has already sampled the hell out of Full Metal Jacket's Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. If it hasn't, what are you waiting for? Go make it. That one's free.
EBM is obsessed with the masculine projection of power, strength, force, brutality, aggression, and military-grade efficiency and productivity. It also has an obsession with wartime propaganda art and iconography.
The artwork of Aiden Hughes and his Brute! style (not to be confused with the other style of art known as brut) is practically synonymous with EBM, and by EBM I mean KMFDM.
Taking this all in might make you feel a little uneasy, like the way you feel around that one friend who just seems a little bit too into German military history, ranks, insignias, and uniforms. Like he even has an old Prussian pickelhaube that he trots out at every New Years.
So just to dispel the notion: Even though it has the veneer of overt fascism, most EBM music is distinctly anti-fascist (it's a German thing. They're not saying they like fascism, they just like the look of fascism. Those Nazis were some snappy dressers).
So EBM is less like Nazi fascism and more like Starship Troopers fascism which is basically space fascism.
This has attracted a class of Industrial Goths known -- originally pejoratively but not anymore -- as Rivetheads. Half-punk, half-goth, half-cyberpunk, half medieval fantasy, half shaven (or skinhead) with military regalia, buttons and badges, jackboots, epaulettes and broad shoulders, and lots of studs, chains, belts, zippers and mail, and always trenchcoats (blame The Matrix for this. And Blade. And The Crow. And The Lost Boys). Which they never take off, not even in the hot sun.
The Rivetheads essentially took the kink-fetish Goth template and replaced the sexy sleaziness with teutonic martial violence (but only for display. Rivetheads are not known for being violent. Unless they encounter actual Nazis). Naturally the Goths hate them even though both frequently attend each other's clubs and concerts. And they totally steal each other's fashion ideas.
"No, we're not a metal band. See, we got synthesizers."
While EBM got its start in the early 80s in (where else) Germany, healthy scenes also sprung up in the UK, Sweden, Belgium, and Vancouver British Columbia of all places (dreary pacific northwest weather makes a good backdrop for a bleak music scene).
This is where Belgium really comes into its own as the #1 European powerhouse of electronic music. Because Belgian EBM is best EBM. They would later parlay their EBM infamy into New Beat and Rave, which is like Michael Jackson parlaying his Off The Wall genius into Thriller.
Later in the decade EBM split into several sub-genres. Chief among these was something called Electro-Industrial or Dark Electro which was essentially just EBM with breakbeats rather than the typical anvil-clanging 4-to-the-floor kicks (think late 80s Cabaret Voltaire or Skinny Puppy).
Electro-Industrial might have gone on to be a thing but then Industrial Rock happened and that stole most of its audience for awhile. The remnants of Electro-Industrial reformed in the late 90s as Aggrotech.
But of all the EBM subgenres that emerged in the late 80s, none were as massive as.... Trance.
Originally a stripped down form of EBM with no vocals, chord progressions or breaks, and just simple looping synth lines over and over with the odd movie sample or two (you could call it Minimal EBM but no one thought to call anything 'minimal' in the age of 'wave' music), Trance came and went as a brief fad in the clubs but outside of the Industrial scene something else happened and.... well, just look below on this guide to see what became of Trance.

An EBM mix with heavy emphasis on the proto-Trance period.
	

EBM is still around today but it mostly serves as a scarier counterpart to its more massively popular descendent Futurepop while the Rivetheads have been taken over by the Cybergoths. I suppose they should have fought harder to preserve their way of life but Rivetheads are just too passive of a subculture for what it's worth.
Ish.


## Futurepop
*aka:  Future Pop, Synthpop, Pop EBM* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in late 90s

Let's get one thing straight: Trance came from German EBM.
It very quickly left to do its own thing in other countries for a decade or so (with stupendously awesome and spectacularly horrendous results), but the baseline of Trance's multifarious origins has always been EBM producers messing around with arpeggiators.
Futurepop is simply Trance finding its way back to its EBM roots after a drunken coke-filled bender in The Netherlands, which can be good or bad depending on which side of the Industrial-Goth scene you lace your corset.
It was invented by VNV Nation (unless it was Apoptygma Berzerk), with the joke being that it was a rehash of retro styles but called "future" (a lot of genres do that. See: Future House, Future Garage, Future Funk, Future Jazz). No one really liked the name but it stuck anyway. Blame the media.
Beborn Beton says: "Wait a second, weren't we doing this shit back in 93? Why does Ronan Harris get the credit?"
The Rivetheads don't like this music. In fact, in the Industrial-Goth scene it's not even called Futurepop. They pejoratively call it Synthpop (and some of them disown in completely). Way too sugary and cute for their menacing fascist pallette. The arpeggios are just too major key, too upper register, too Ned Flanders. Too doodly-oodly. I blame Icon of Coil.
Icon of Coil is like the AC/DC of Futurepop. Sure, every song sounds the same but it's a really good song and you never get tired of it.
Of course the Cybergoths love it which means that today this is all there is. The classic EBM sound has been swept aside in favor of this relatively poppy, teeny-bopper accessible candy-coated sugar EBM variant for people who wear neon fucking streamers in their hair. Today, most "Industrial" music that you hear is either this or Aggrotech. Both are Cybergoth nesting grounds.
And to be fair, from an Industrial standpoint there is a lot to hate about Futurepop. The bands look like Nu Metal and Emo rejects, the songs use Eurotrance presets for leads, there is nothing here that hasn't already been raped to death by a thousand Dutch tracks. Only thing missing is the supersaws (but I wouldn't put it past them).
Next they'll use obnoxious Hardstyle anthems if they haven't already.
Not the worst combination idea.
Now ask yourself: Do we really need that in our EBM? It's a total jump-the-shark move, like a sit-com on TV that's run out of ideas so it resorts to plots like two characters switching bodies or some other hilarity that doesn't ensue.
And the lyrics: Same ole' spitting about five year plans and oppressive governments, but also more personal diatribes about how tortured they are and how their feelings matter a lot. Like Trent Reznor but more insipid.
Today the name Futurepop is being co-opted by a number of other scenes, mostly due to the fault of dumbass music writers who don't know Futurepop exists and think some new bullshit Hipster sound they've encountered is something they can coin in the most unoriginal way possible and get lots of infamy for it.
Protip guys: Don't do that.
Ish.


## New Beat
*aka:  Death Disco, Dark Disco, Nu Disco, Slo-beat, Chug, Slow Techno* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in late 80s, and then early 10s

Some electronic music genres can trace their origin to a single label, artist or even album. Belgian New Beat (or just New Beat) is one of those genres that can trace its origins to a single song. And the exact time and place it happened.
As legend has it, in 1986 DJ Fat Ronnie -- resident in legendary Antwerp club Ancienne Belgique -- accidentally played EBM hit A Split Second - Flesh at 33 rpm, not its intended speed of 45 rpm. The result was a slow, lethargic dirge that conveyed apathy and disaffectedness, essentially turning a menacing EBM track into a melancholy Gothy track.
Here's the difference between the two:

DJs would actually play it at 33 1/3 +8 for some extra oomph. That's the version in this clip.
	

As Bob Ross would say: There are no mistakes, only happy accidents. The beat was a thick, slow, inevitable thud chugging along at sub-120 bpm like a menacing but slow moving hurricane, pounding at you with galloping basslines and tweaky melodies. It was a beat that no one had heard before. You might say it was a different kind of beat. An original beat. A novel beat.
As it turns out, a lot of EBM tracks work this way (and even some non-EBM tracks like, say, Yello - Oh Yeah). Before long DJs were laying down any fast-tempo music at reduced speed and labelling it as such (100-105 bpm seems to be the sweet spot), and eventually producers took to the studio to churn out original tracks with this specific look and feel.
It came at just the right time too, as EBM slowed down was the perfect tempo for mixing into those dispassionate Chicago Acid House records flooding the market, and Belgium's proximity to England meant that it was in the rave splash zone. While the rest of Industrial-Goth was driven by the old format of bands and live shows, New Beat's irresistably addictive cadence fit more with the DJ and producer-dominated world of club culture.
Unlike the aggressive military motifs of EBM, New Beat was sleazier, with pornographic samples and erotic live shows culled from the kink-fetish scene (and I'm not just talking about Lords of Acid). It rarely had any uplifting melodies, choruses or lyrics. The dark sexiness, prolific sampling, and thundering percussion gave it the nickname: Death Disco. No builds, no breakdowns, no anthems. Just raw rhythms at a danceable pace.

Move your ass and feel the beat.
	

For a few brief glorious years, New Beat was cruising like Al Pacino in a leatherdaddy nightclub. But as quick as it came it went, and by the early 90s New Beat was old beat -- it was subsumed into the new sounds of Hip House, Italo House, Rave, and Hardcore. The early 90s was a period of explosive development in electronic music that has yet to be surpassed so a lot of great genres back then were flash-in-the-pans that really deserve more care and consideration.
That's exactly what some memberberry-eating producers realized when The Great Revival Of All Things 80s in the 2010s hit electronic music right in the nostalgias and a forbidden lovechild of New Beat and Tech House developed in multiple locations (like Madrid, Ireland and Staffordshire).
Sometimes called New Beat but also called Slo-Beat, Nu Disco, Chug (as in chug-a-lug, the sound the beat makes. Not a racist term), Dark Disco, Slow Techno and a bevy of other names.
It's been a long hiatus but I'm glad to see New Beat back in the game. Electronic music needs it more than ever to fight the twin forces of drop-anthemitis and monotonous plinky plonk.

New Beat does what we've only ever wanted electronic music to do: Move our asses and feel the beat.
Ish.


## Darkwave
*aka:  Goth, Electro-Goth, Coldwave, Doom Wave, Witch House, Neoclassical Darkwave, Vaporwave* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in early 80s

Darkwave is Goth music. It is Goth's lone electronic representation on this guide. It is beloved by all the Goths.
What are the Goths? Well, the Goths are a group of Germanic people from the Baltic lowlands who wandered all over Europe from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE. Over a period of two hundred years they gradually encountered, and then allied with, and then enlisted in, and then invaded, and then conquered the Western Roman Empire, instigating the European Middle Ages. While doing this they split into two groups and carved out territory for themselves: The Eastern Goths established a kingdom in Italy while the Western Goths established a kingdom in Spain. They didn't last long: The Eastern Goths fought a brutal war with the Eastern Roman Empire that depopulated Italy by about two-thirds and exhausted both sides to near defeat leaving Italy exposed to conquest by the Lombards ten years later. The Western Goths in Spain lasted a little longer until they were overwhelmed by the enthusiastic armies of the upstart religion of Islam.
1500 years later, Goths are now this:
You may be Goth, but you'll never be pet-raven-riding-the-subway Goth.
And their architecture looks like this:
Like a giant drip sand castle.
But I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
Goth is not just a scene unto itself. It is also a literary genre, a lifestyle, a culture, a makeup preference, and a monochromatic dress code.
The number of Goth genres dwarf all other scenes on this guide: Goth Rock, Goth Pop, Goth Classical, Goth Neo-Classical, Goth Neo-Victorian Classical, Steampunk Goth, Goth Folk, Goth Pop/Bubble Goth, Goth Industrial, Goth Metal/Heavy Goth, etc. Fortunately none of these genres need to be here. Goth is primarily a non-electronic music scene so we can safely ignore practically all of it and only focus on the one or two Goth genres and their derivatives that are genuinely electronic. That's this: Darkwave (and to a lesser extent Ethereal).
Even though Goth is its own scene, the electronic side can be folded into Industrial for convenience's sake and because you don't have to know who Peter Murphy is to get into this kind of music. Also because there is a lot of cross-pollination between Goths and Rivetheads (As amazing as it sounds: People who wear black are into music that other people who wear black are into. Who would've guessed).
And this is what Goths look like when they don't have a Goth culture to partake in. Because they live in the middle of buttfuck nowhere.
Darkwave actually came from Coldwave, a fleeting non-electronic Goth microgenre that was only popular in France and Belgium in the late 70s and early 80s. Coldwave was a distinct, morose, minor-key-all-the-time take on New Wave, the non-electronic Punk subgenre that started the 80s fad of calling every genre some form of "wave" (including Neo Wave, No Wave, Nu Wave, Noo Wave, and Ni Wave which was a Monty Python variant).
Eventually Darkwave picked up synths and samplers but kept the pipe organs, treated guitars with heavy reverb that sound like a wailing banshee, and sometimes live drums and the melodramatic 'New Romantic' motif to stay separate from the fascist foot-stomping two minutes hate of EBM. Or to put it another way: Darkwave is every band trying their hardest to sound like a suicidally depressed Depeche Mode (in contrast to EBM which wants to kill mother fucking Depeche Mode).
There are a number of subgenres that have come out of Darkwave since then including Doom Wave, Witch House and Vaporwave, but Vaporwave isn't a genre insomuch as it's just a technique, like Chopped And Screwed or Nightcore.
Darkwave will always be around because Goths will always be around, hanging out behind the school smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee and complaining that everyone else is a conformist.

But this is what Goths really look like.
Truth be known, Goths aren't morbidly depressed people who've given up on fashion and life. They're just upset that no one else has.
Ish.



## Ethereal
*aka:  Ethereal Wave, Ethereal Goth, Ethereal Darkwave* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in mid 80s

Ethereal Goth, Ethereal Darkwave, Ethereal Industrial or whatever you want to call it (just plain Ethereal will do) is the Ambient/beatless side of Goth music.
Goth music has always been heavy on texture and atmospherics. The guitars are always wet, the beats are always cavernous and distant, the vocals are always tortured and self-involved and full of teenage pronoun poetry.
Ethereal takes the reverb and flange abuse to new levels of spaceous loneliness. It's the perfect soundtrack for camping overnight in a cemetary or putting on vampire fangs and eating uncooked steak pretending its flesh or staying home and slowly watching a rose wilt on the window sill or painting your fingernails charcoal, lighting some candles and watching Fairuza Balk movies.
The Indie subgenres of Shoegaze and Dreampop are heavily informed by Ethereal but they're not technically Goth genres because they're too peppy. And they're not culturally Goth, they're something worse: Hipsters. And as far as I know Hipsters won't listen to any music that's not gluten-free.
Ethereal has a few interesting characteristics that distinguish it from other Goth or Industrial genres. For one it is dominated by women, probably because guys can't sound sinisterly angelic enough. And the Goths that are into this music like to wear faerie wings which just doesn't work for guys. No, do not argue this. It doesn't work. Tutus, yes. But not faerie wings. I don't care how much you want to. Look, just dress like Jareth from Labyrinth and you'll be alright. Use a potato.
I'm only covering Faerie Goths, Rivetheads and Cybergoths in this guide, but according to some people there are up to 33 different kinds of Goths.
Ethereal is also the only Industrial/Goth genre that is largely instrumental if you don't count angelic harmonies, breathy chanting or a ceaseless wall of wailing as actual vocals. This unique affectation comes from the Cocteau Twins, the band that essentially invented the sound and is responsible for Ethereal's distinct motif of indecipherable lyrical content. Everyone else is just trying to sound like Elizabeth Fraser.
If you can't tell the difference between this and Dark Ambient, I don't blame you. While both strive for morbid melodrama, Ethereal is more operatic and classical with lots of celtic, wiccan, and pagan cultural and musical iconography, to the point where you might think that this music is used for seances or mother earth priestess rituals that require blood sacrifices and dancing skyclad around a wicker man. Dark Ambient doesn't have anything that cool going for it. Except maybe US politics.
On the one hand, creepy ritual. On the other, cute naked pagan chicks. What do?
Lately Ethereal has picked up UK Garage and IDM-style beats making it more of a Chill Out genre than an Ambient one (sentences like these really make much more sense if you read the whole guide). It is still around today but it's heyday was the 80s and 90s (ie: when the Cocteau Twins were around). The good news is it will always have a use as long as Halloween exists.
Ish.


## Industrial Rock
*aka:  Industrial Metal* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in mid 80s

Rock music has been chasing new sounds since the 1960s because there's only so much you can do with a 6-string guitar. Each innovation in technology and attitude produces a new genre.
Fuzz boxes and distortion pedals gave us Hard Rock (and later on Heavy Metal). Brass bands and LSD gave us Psychedelic Rock. Analog synthesizers and noodly 16 hour solos gave us Progressive Rock. Smashing shit and not knowing how to play gave us Punk Rock. Heroin and homelessness gave us Grunge Rock. And Noise and Industrial gave us this: Industrial Rock. The only music that's safe for nerds to listen to in high school and not get the living crap beaten out of them.
A lot of bands combined metal riffs with abrasive textures and maybe also drum machines in the 80s so it wasn't like it was some crazy original idea. But the guy who really gave it some focus was probably Al Jourgensen, frontman for Ministry -- a band that got its start peddling androgynous melancholy New Wave/Synthpop to cute little goth chicks before evolving within the span of two albums through drum-charged EBM and settling its sound on the quiet-verse-loud-chorus screamy Metal with drum machines that became a hallmark feature of the genre.
Al Jourgensen has been trying to disown his New Romantic hearthrob days for his entire career, so let's keep reminding him that he can't.
This convinced a young Trent Reznor -- working as a janitor at a record studio at the time -- to loudly declare "I want to make a Ministry album too!", begged his boss to lend him the studio afterhours and the result was Pretty Hate Machine.
While we're at it: Underworld too. lol Karl.
Like a lot of super famous acts that got super famous, Reznor and his side project Nine Inch Nails (second only to his main project of being Trent Reznor) arrived at just the right time, when rock music had grown tired of neon spandex, eyeliner, leather pants, full-volume treated hair, squealy guitar solos, and falsetto singing. Living through such an era could depress even the most optimistic and hardiest of generations, and when the Heavy Metal stock market crashed at the end of the 80s they sought solace in Grunge and Industrial Rock music (collectively called Alternative, as in Alternative To What We Just Wasted a Whole God Damn Decade Listening To).
While Grunge was moody, angry, disaffected, dreary and angst-riddled, Industrial Rock was all those things too... but it was super intense about it. It provided the antidote to the suicidal depression of Grunge, which is to say stop moping about your suicidal depression and start bragging about it. In effect, turning mopey narcissism into attention whoring mopey narcissism. While the content and attitude of both genres was pretty similar, Industrial Rock did have one thing going for it and that was Trent Reznor. Grunge didn't have anyone like that (or it did but they all killed themselves).
So you have a guy making music with chorus lines that can't be uttered in public making videos that can't be aired because they resemble Faces of Death yet still winning Grammys and going Platinum anyway. That probably should not have happened. Almost singlehandedly, Reznor made the ugly, the macabre, the morbid, the tortured, the self-loathing and self-harm, and all the freakishness of the undercultures of the world suddenly very cool.

Michael Ironside and Ministry once convinced young teenage Ishkur to drink Molson beer. Also: Giving young teenage Ishkur Molson beer would have been enough to convince young teenage Ishkur to drink Molson beer.
	

The underground probably didn't like that but truth be known even if you removed Trent Reznor this would still be the most popular Industrial genre by a long shot. So there was bound to be some blowback. Same thing happens to any scene when one of its genres inexplicably becomes a mainstream fad.
So for a brief period in the 90s, this genre was pop music. The "Industrial" explosion of groups like Filter, Stabbing Westward, Rob Zombie, and yes of course him followed in Reznor's wake, both in style and substance. Industrial Rock soundtracks dominated video games like Command & Conquer and action movies starring 5'3" 105 lb. All-American goth grrrls in black vinyl bodysuits with great outside-inside crescent kicks beating up mooks twice their size. Those movies are still technically popular especially among actresses named Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovovich.
This album is actually not that bad. Movie is fucking terrible though.
How much of this is electronic? Precious little, actually. Industrial Rock was more Rock than Industrial, and while it still attracted the rivethead faithful, its immense popularity was not welcomed by the Industrial scene at large. Today you might get away with dropping a Nine Inch Nails song at a club (you know, for the nostalgia), but playing it back then would be like playing Bee Gees at a Disco: It outed you as a poseur. It's just not what anyone well invested in the scene wanted to hear.
Industrial Rock is still around today, although in accordance with the decline of rock music the better artists make Aggrotech instead.
Ish.


## Aggrotech
*aka:  Hellektro, Dark Electro, Cyber-Industrial* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in late 90s

Aggrotech is Industrial Rock without the Rock. Or EBM without the arps.
Not to be confused for the artist Aggrotech -- just kidding, there is no one named Aggrotech. In fact, no one's sure what the "Aggro" part even means. It could be short for "aggressive" or it could be short for "aggravation" or it could even be short for "agriculture", who knows. I personally think it refers to the "Agrodome", the PNE sports complex in Vancouver British Columbia that was the set of the fight between Rocky Balboa and Ivan Drago in Rocky IV.
It's like the inverse of the 2016 US Presidential election.
In many ways Aggrotech was an attempt to get away from Industrial Rock which was big and popular and mainstream and it convinced an entire generation of rivethead poseurs to shop at Hot Topic.
Every scene has its moronic popular genre: Drum n Bass has Pendulum, Progressive has McProg, Eurotrance has Eurotrance. Hell, it wasn't even something that only Industrial was going through at the time as Breaks was suffering the Big Beat explosion (with both genres featured prominently in "leather & legkicks" action movies).
I should also mention that Industrial-Goth has the unique characteristic of being the only electronic music scene where most of the music is recorded, produced and performed live. By bands with actual instruments as opposed to producers and DJs mixing records. This is true of Aggrotech -- the youngest genre -- and it is still true today of all the genres. Even in the age of push-button sample-dropping VST simplicity, Aggrotech keeps things real, with real levels redlined at real shows while real lead singers scream real incomprehensible lyrics into real microphones. Really.
Aggrotech initially adopted the look of modern horror (read: torture porn) and the occult in the wake of Marilyn Manson's "freakshow" aesthetics. After he went away it picked up cheesier ideas from Hardstyle and Electropop, merging a goth ethos with glam and cyberpunk to give us a new look: The Cybergoth.
The Cybergoth has since come to dominate all modern Industrial genres including Futurepop and Darkwave. The music in accordance has gotten poppier and raver-friendly to the point where fans of their gritty underground ancestors make a salient case for expelling them from the Industrial-Goth scene altogether.
Cybergoths: What happens when you take the stock Rivethead look and add Steampunk, mecha anime, and The Predator.
When people talk of modern Industrial music, this is what they usually think of. Search for Industrial mixes on Youtube and this is likely what comes up. It has many names including Dark Electro (why?) and Cyber-Industrial, but the best name is Aggrotech because even though it's a meaningless name it's at least unique and not some lazy adjective applied to an existing genre like Hard Ambient or Vocal Chiptune or Uplifting Hop.
In addition to being the face of Industrial (when it really has no right to be), Aggrotech also wins the coveted award of Least Coherent Lyrics in not just electronic music but arguably all music (with the possible exception of Dancehall. And Ethereal doesn't count because they're not really saying anything). You have better odds trying to understand Elizabeth Fraser barking Cookie Monster Death Metal choruses through her fist into a lead pipe full of bees.
As to what the lyrical content is about is anybody's guess, but Aggrotech seems to aim for the tortured anger of Trent Reznor and the astute socio-political commentary of Marilyn Manson but without the coherence or insight.
Lack of vocal diversity (and range) doesn't mean the genre is bland. Quite the opposite, Aggrotech has some of the most interesting music in Industrial, even though it does sometimes get so extreme it inverts into parody.
As a final namedrop, no discussion of Industrial or Aggrotech can be complete without mentioning the ongoing Pigface project -- the Alan Smithee of Industrial music (but not in a derogatory way).
Pigface is a one-time supergroup organized by Martin Atkins and a revolving cast of contributors. There is no definitive Pigface lineup. Everyone from Trent Reznor to KMFDM to Alex Patterson to Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, and over a hundred other artists and groups have worked on the Pigface project at one time or another, running off dozens of one-off singles, albums and remixes over a period of 30 years. Some of it is Aggrotech but a lot of it isn't even electronic. But the concept itself is too cool to not mention.
Ish.


## Industrial
*aka:  Experimental Rock* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in late 70s

Industrial -- both the scene and the genre -- is music that seeks to upset the status quo.
It emerged in the late 70s as a companion to the nascent countercultural sounds of Punk which attacked society with raw, unfocused rage. But where Punk advocated anarchy and breaking shit and little else, Industrial was cerebral and artistic and had its shit together. Punk was provocative for the sake of being provocative. Industrial was provocative for a reason -- it had a point to make.
To put it metaphorically, if you hate tattoos, Punk would get another one just to piss you off while Industrial would convince you that tattoos are invaluable works of art which might still piss you off but at least it wouldn't be out of spite.
While the grand list of references and influences are vast and varied (Industrial is one of the few genres that has an exhaustively researched entry on Wikipedia although it seems to have been written by hardcore Cabaret Voltaire fanboys), for the most part Industrial exists primarily due to the human-alien hybrid Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (the artist formerly known as Genesis P-Orridge), who carved out a career spanning decades exposing us to the hot new extraterrestrial sounds from around the galaxy.
Any day now Genesis is going to tell us "My work here is done. I must return to my home planet now." and the rest of us will go "So long and thanks for all the choons".
P-Orridge and h/er label Industrial Records gave this sound a name, and h/er band Throbbing Gristle gave this sound a sound.
The concept behind Industrial was that any sound could be music. Any sound at all. And it doesn't have to be rhythmic either. In fact, it's better if it's not. Throbbing Gristle even infamously boasted using no drummer because drummers invariably fall into patterns and grooves and P-Orridge's band of merry pranksters found that too restrictive. Their music had to be free of all constraints and rules of what proper music should sound like. This was decades before Bjork made the "everything is music" motif a thing with her Manic Pixie Dream Girl persona.

Here Genesis explains that if you want to be a music pioneer, don't do anything musical.
	

It's not a unique idea. French experimentalists, German futurists and Detroit automotive workers also explored the idea of making music from random sounds, but Throbbing Gristle and Industrial Records gave it a unique edge born out of post-punk art stunt terrorism, street activism, lower class degradation, rejection of society and authority, and a screaming rebelliousness as the Thatcher/Reagan era loomed and the working classes saw their idyllic post-war way of life squeezed by predatory Capitalism. Really, there was no better time for Industrial to come of age than in the hyper-commercial 80s. Every thesis needs an antithesis.
But where Musique Concrete and Experimental were insular and dorky and not really appealing to anybody, Industrial appealed to the renegade undercultures of society, especially kink/fetish, LGBTQ, Bohemian art collectives, and political deviants (Marxists, Anarchists, Fascists, and other losers of 20th century wars).
Industrial music is a political art-stunt statement as much as it is a musical statement, arguing for freedom of expression and deconstruction of the rules of society while simultaneously deconstructing the rules of music. The people attracted to this ideology were naturally the ones who didn't fit in, or worse yet found society increasingly hostile to their way of life. The punks, the goths, the rivetheads, the runaways, the trans gendered, the body modders, the junkies and sex workers of the streets criticized as being "Wreckers of Civilization" because they weren't a viable target market or pertinent cultural demographic. People too extreme to be pandered to politically and too small to be targeted commercially.
You don't have to be a social outcast to participate in this scene but understand that it was built by them, and it's always been home for anyone who feels like they don't belong anywhere else.
From these meagre beginnings -- not a rage against the system like Punk but rather a casual rejection of it -- Industrial has established the template for the avant-garde, the macabre, the dark, the moody, and the irresistable drive toward distortion and noise as a worthy musical endeavor.
This is the opening salvo of a very massive, very influential, and very popular scene not just in music but in art, fashion, and lifestyle. It is a blueprint for looking at the world, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad, sometimes because it's full of shit.
You can choose to like it or hate it or completely dismiss what it's trying to do, but you can't deny the impact it has had on society at large. Its ideas still live on in dozens of genres and hundreds of subgenres today.
It's still one hell of an an awful racket, though.
Ish.


## Collage
*aka:  Sound Collage, Sampling, Tape Looping, Plunderphonics, Mashup* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in mid 50s

Collage, also known as Sound Collage, Tape Editing or Sample music (or later on Plunderphonics), is music made from parts of music, like a Frankengenre.
Collage literally means "gluing" in French, as in cutting out and pasting together other works of art, and it has existed in music long before tween girls smothered their trapper keepers in boyband pictures carefully and obsessively clipped from pedophile magazines.
Some definitions date Collage back to the 17th century which is kind of stupid when you consider recording technology didn't even exist until 1879. But the modern form of it can't exist without recording technology, even though recording technology isn't technically electronic.
What a collage might look like. If you were to make an audio version of this specific collage -- like nothing but ad jingles -- it would be sued for copyright infringement. But it's okay if it's art.
Collage is a direct descendent of Musique Concrete. Both utilize sampling in their repertoire but Collage differs from the snooty French experimentalists in how and what it samples (and why). Musique Concrete was largely interested in unconventional sounds and things that were not necessarily musical. Collage began almost immediately as a novelty genre targeting established works of music and even in its most earnest it always sounds parodic.
Since Collage needs published works to exist in order to exist itself, it had to wait for the recording industry (not just music but also television, radio, films, news services, and any other broadcast industry) to mature and build libraries of interesting sounds for Collage to pilfer. It also had to wait for technology to make it easy to sample and record other works and that just wasn't technically possible before the 1950s (also the war n stuff).
With the advent of multitrack recorders (especially the Ampex 8-track recorder released in 1955), studios and producers graduated to a new level of control over music's output (there's more on this that I'll explain elsewhere).
Probably the first official sample-heavy Collage track was Buchanan And Goodman - The Flying Saucer, a goofy 1956 novelty hit that used parts of various popular songs as cutaway gags in a news broadcast, like Family Guy jokes:

Remember that they had to do this by hand through reel-to-reel multi-track tape recorders. Ask your great grandparents what that is.
	

Of course they were sued for this. Amazingly they won, quite possibly because the industry was so green and the judge was so naive and no laws yet existed for this sort of thing that there was nothing to rule against. This was a brand new field and there were no regulations telling you what you could or could not do with it. The judge even considered it a new work and called it "artful and clever". From this point on, it was okay to sample.
Not that it mattered because in this primitive period the barrier to entry was too high. Very few home consumers had access to the recording tools necessary for sampling at any rate. And with every release, every hit, and every innovation that emerged Collage had to fight a burgeoning recording industry that simply denied Collage's right to exist as art, much less music, much less a commercial product.
Collage works were either goofy one-offs by nobodies like Audrey - Dear Elvis, a fangirl's love letter to Elvis using music samples to convey her emotions (so just like today's teens). Or they were tape mangled explorations like James Tenney - Collage #1 which also heavily sampled Elvis but in a different way. Sampling Elvis was popular in the early days of sampling because James Brown had not been invented yet.
And then there was The Beatles - Revolution 9, a Collage masterpiece mess that was the culmination of John Lennon and George Harrison raiding the Abbey Road vaults for anything interesting and spending two days getting stoned and lying on the cutting room floor splicing together random spools of tape. And what better place for an 8 minute waste of mind than on a schizophrenic double album that was 1.5 albums worth of nonsense filler, unfinished radio jingles, and thinly veiled cries for help, and 0.5 albums worth of genuinely good music with the polite subtext of "Would you please get that fucking bitch out of the studio." But I digress.
As the recording industry metamorphosed into the soul-munching pop money machine that would dominate teenage bedrooms until the end of the century, the fight over music proprietorship increased which just so happened to coincide with the number of high-powered lawyers the industry could afford.
Almost as a reaction to this, Collage music became more rebellious and militant, pitting itself as a dashing revolutionary fighting against Capitalism with culture jamming heroics (probably while wearing a Che shirt). It used the Copyleft or Kopyright appellations as a mockery of copyright law, with a (k) symbol as a double meaning (it also denotes kallisti, Greek for beautiful, the first letter of which was inscribed on the Apple of Discord tossed in the midst of the feast of the gods by Eris, the Goddess of Chaos and patron saint of Anarchism. This starts the Trojan War after Paris--look, just go read The Illiad).
Groups like Negativland and The Residents built entire careers out of snubbing the establishment and provoking it by sampling famous artists, and then when they were caught, sampling that too, broadcasting everything as a forerunner to Internet media. Despite all this Collage remained very much a niche genre well into the 80s.
And then samplers arrived. Chiefly the E-mu SP-1200 sampler in 1987:
The far superior Akai S900 sampler came out a year earlier but no one at the street level could afford the $3000 in 80s dollars.
Samplers had existed since at least the 60s in various forms, but they were always accompaniments of larger systems and they were prohibitively expensive. That soured the market and dampened Collagist aspirations for awhile, but by the 80s samplers got smaller, cheaper, and more specialized.
E-mu Systems had released a number of drum machines and samplers prior to this one, but the SP-1200 was the one that blew the door wide open. It was cheap, small, and easy to use right out of the box. It was now capable to not only have a hit song, but hit albums, hit careers, and entire hit record labels off this one device.
The SP-1200 was simultaneously a godsend and a horrifying omen to the music industry and no one demonstrated this double-edged sword better than Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, who  as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu made an entire prank album with it, got sued by ABBA forcing them to never release the album, burned all the masters and released it anyway with the copyright infringing samples removed but with instructions on how to recreate the album at home, followed up with a sample-filled album a year later complaining about copyright law, then made a one-off sample-filled novelty hit for some fuck you money, renamed themselves The Kopyright Liberation Front and over the next three years proceeded to change electronic music forever.
They also wrote a tell-all book about how you too can make a number one hit single with just some marketing savvy and an SP-1200 sampler. Many artists from Chumbawamba to The Chainsmokers have admitted to following this book's timeless advice.
There's more to say about The KLF (a lot more), but I'll save that for another time.
But that's nothing compared to what the SP-1200 did to other electronic music scenes, launching the Golden Ages of Hip Hop, House, New Beat, Hip House, R&B, Breaks, etc. The ease of sampling no longer made it a Collage-only thing. Now it was a pop thing. Now it was a problem.
Various countries dealt with music copyright law in their own way but generally when the dust settled sampling without permission was no longer allowed (not even a fraction of a drum hit). That wasn't a problem for Collagists who made the music for art and not for sale, but for commercial artists it brought so much legal trouble that it effectively snuffed the genre out.
The commercial sample era only lasted for about ten years (87-96 give or take), with the absolute zenith being The Beastie Boys - Paul's Boutique in 1989:
Basically a Collage album.... with rapping.
Produced by the Dust Brothers and containing over a hundred samples and no native instrumentation (except for vocals), Paul's Boutique stands out as not just a great album, but as a relic of an era that will never return. We will never hear anything like this or see it chart or sell a million copies ever again. It's just not legally or financially feasible. This artform as a commercial product was literally lawyered into extinction.
That doesn't mean Collage music or sampling is dead. Quite the contrary, it received a boost in the 2000s with the rise of Mashup culture, a Turntablism subgenre that liked to mix-and-match rap acapellas over top pop hits (or in Danger Mouse's case entire albums). And while that doesn't have the raw expression and creativity of the golden age of sampling, it's still something I guess.
Collage music doesn't like rules. More specifically, it doesn't like anyone telling it what it can or cannot do with music. Legal rules about music rights and ownership have effectively killed Collage as a commercial genre, but it still exists in the underground as a valuable form of art, spreading via Soundcloud and Bandcamp or other free music sharing services. Because true creativity doesn't care about the law.
Especially something as humorous and dead serious as Collage music.
Ish.


## Noise
*aka:  Power Electronics, Power Noise, Noisecore, Wall Noise, Japanoise, Death Industrial* in the Industrial/Goth scene, emerged in early 60s

Some genres are virtually unlistenable but you can still appreciate them on an artistic or technical level even if you don't like them a whole lot.
Not the case with Noise because Noise is not music. Noise is exactly what it is: Noise. It is the sonic equivalent of eating human hair dipped in vaseline, and just as enjoyable.
But that's the point. Most people don't think a microphone feedback squeal is very appealing. And then there's the type of people who are like "Make that sound louder!" probably just to spite the people who hate it.
Chewing tin foil, scraping fingernails across a chalkboard, rubbing sandpaper against styrofoam -- the more abrasive it is, the more they love it. The more uncomfortable it feels, the more painful it hurts your ears, the more filthy, dirty and grimy it is, the better they like it. This is music for The Addams Family. It is audio sado-masochism.
Where should we start with Noise? Probably at the beginning: Grog in 65,000 BCE banging a stick against a rock. Or a heavy rainfall hitting a tin roof. Or a bunch of sound engineers wacked out on meth going absolutely apeshit in the Foley-studio:
"Look, King Kong doesn't actually exist so I can make him sound like anything I want."
But that's not really electronic so the cutoff is real sounds. If you can believe it there are multiple genres of Noise. It is almost a scene onto itself. But this guide is focused on just the electronic Noise, and I'm folding all of its various styles into one Noise genre because who wants more than one genre of this stuff? Really now.
The two most popular Noise genres are Power Electronics and Power Noise. Power Electronics came first in the early 80s, and Power Noise came later in the 90s, probably as an offshoot. What's the difference between the two? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
(stuff like this only matters to super pedantic types, like the people who whine about the decade officially starting with year "1" or complain that sentences should have one space after a period instead of 2)
By far the most prolific Noise artist is Merzbow, an insane Japanese musician (and being insane for Japanese means it is a special brand of insanity unique only to Japan) who has released hundreds of albums over four decades, each one pushing his sanity into ever more insane levels of insanity.
One could consider his entire body of work to be one giant art exhibit: This is what it looks like when a total schizoid with no filter publishes everything he makes, which is generally not what musicians do (cf. Sturgeon's Law). Even The Beatles threw out hundreds of songs they thought were no good (and even then some crap still got published. Just look at the White Album).
Dissident sounds can sometimes be good. Where would Jimi Hendrix or Trent Reznor be without their distortion pedals and overdriven fuzz boxes? But Noise isn't interested in making a bad sound sound good when it sounds bad. It loves bad sounds that sound bad because bad sounds sound bad. If bad sounds sound good then bad sounds wouldn't sound like bad sounds that sound bad, would they? Think about it.
We humans appreciate music because of its repetition -- the anticipation, the rhythmness. One of the easiest ways to increase someone's anxiety levels is to jump scare them, which is easy to do and can be applied to anyone at any time. It's scary because they're not expecting it. Music has a clockwork-like predictability that we enjoy and calculate in our heads even if we don't understand the mathematical symmetry that make us like the music.
This applies not just to music but to anything. And we do it without even noticing. Try it: Turn your television to a channel with all snow (if televisions can still do that) and watch it intently for a bit. After awhile you'll start to see patterns in both the audio and the video but they're not really there. They're hallucinations brought upon by apophenia -- your brain attempting to organize the mess in front of you into something orderly and recognizable.
The human brain's desire to find patterns in the capriciousness of nature is one of evolution's great advantages. It can be a good thing, like knowing on which day every year the river's going to flood. Or it can be a bad thing, like hearing voices in the shower. You should probably see a psychiatrist if that happens. There is such a thing as seeing too many patterns in random things. That's where all conspiracy theories come from.

Listening to Noise forces you to find patterns within the randomness. I'm not saying that is a good reason to listen to Noise. But it is a reason.
Ish.

# Intelligent Dance Music

## Breakcore
*aka:  Raggacore, Chipcore, J-Core* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in late 90s

Drill n Bass was IDM mixed with Drum n Bass. Breakcore -- its successor -- is IDM mixed with Hardcore, with some Industrial seasoning and Thrash Metal to taste.
Aggressive genres like to get harder and nastier as time goes on, with each producer looking for a fatter, crunchier, more teeth-rattling sound to put their track over the top and own the dancefloor during the peak rave hour, when everyone's serotonin has run out and they're burning dopamine.
So the spastic breakbeats of Drill n Bass got more distorted and slamming, and infused with chipmunk samples and other nuttiness to such an extent that one could call this the heir apparent to Oldskool Rave Hardcore.
But where Oldskool Rave had a template and a theme and kept to it, Breakcore was more trendwhorish, willing to adopt the prevalant musical mores and norms of any given zeitgeist. From Brostep belches to Trap snares to Death Metal riffs (complete with Cookie Monster vocals) to samples of race car engines, sirens, and ragga MCs, nothing is outside the purview of Breakcore as long as it sounds harsh and aggressive.
This is honestly the kind of music that people won't like unless Vice Magazine (or Pitchfork) tells them it's cool to like it.
For once, this genre did not come from Richard D. James. It actually has its origins in mid-90s sonic arsonists like Alec Empire and Atari Teenage Riot, who pushed their own brand of noisy Thrash Metal Gabber called Digital Hardcore, a genre that only existed for one album.
Breakcore didn't become an IDM thing until Venetian Snares flooded the genre with twenty-one albums in eight years, consistently pushing out A-list content like he's some kind of IDM Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The secret to such prolific productivity is to live in a frozen shithole like Winnipeg Manitoba, where there's nothing to do during the 11-month long winter season except watch the Bluebombers (or the Jets) lose to the Stampeders (or the Flames) over and over again (and the radio plays Anne Murray. All day. Every day). That's a pro tip, producers: Isolate yourself from the world to beat those procrastination prickle bushes.
Because when you're snowed in you better make sure your studio has a lot of patch cables.
Because it openly rapes utilizes sounds from other scenes, Breakcore has a countless number of subgenres. Three of the biggest are Raggacore, which is just Ragga Jungle sped up (and some other trifling things done to it), Chipcore which is Breakcore with Chiptune samples (all Chipcore tunes are sorted in the Plus genre), and J-Core, which is borderline Happy Hardcore because it contains ridiculously cheesy J-Pop and anime samples and influences (mostly Hentai because of course it does). But healthy subgenres curated from other scenes exist as well, including Metal, Hip Hop, and of course Dubstep. Fucking Dubstep in everything.
When you think about it, just about any genre can be given the spastic breakbeat treatment of Breakcore and it would sound okay. And because the intention behind it is taking the piss Breakcore stands alone as the one IDM genre that doesn't have a stick up its bum.
It is to be commended for that stupid fact alone.
Ish.


## Drill n Bass
*aka:  Jungle IDM* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in mid 90s

Drill n Bass loves the Amen Break just as much as Drum n Bass.
But just laying out the infamous 6-second loop without texture is too boring for IDM snobs so they took to sampling each individual drum hit of the Amen -- the kick, the snare, the hi-hat, the cymbal -- and re-sequenced them in new patterns, with heavy texturization and circuit bending and noise tweaking and distortion and other studio gimmickry.
The result was not complex insomuch as it was just busy and schizophrenic, like Jackson Pollock art. If you wrote this genre in musical notation, it would probably look something like this:
I don't know what this is, but Richard D. James probably conducted it.
This is yet another Aphex Twin-created genre (quite possibly done on a lark, to take the piss out of his earlier works), only this time he had help: Namely from Squarepusher and Plug (and then later on Venetian Snares and µ-Ziq). Because there is no limit to the number of arhythmic patterns you can come up with when you don't have to care about rhythm.
To the snobs busy and fast equals smart and sophisticated, which ironically makes Drill n Bass the dumbest genre of IDM. It doesn't have the subtlety that you would find in its cousins Braindance and Ambient Techno, just raw in-your-face rhythms grinding their way into your brain like the Ceti eel from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (no, the other one. The good one).
This might have been enough to sustain Drill n Bass into a long-lasting genre but a couple things were working against it.
First off, its blunt simplicity wasn't conducive for a scene priding itself on being snooty. And secondly, its ideas were quickly co-opted by the Drum n Bass and Hardcore scenes anyway, which means too much competition in an already limited marketspace.
By the 2000s everyone had moved on to Breakcore and Drill n Bass was no longer needed, like buggy whip carriages in the age of the automobile or child chimney sweepers in the age of midgets.
But as a stepping stone genre, Drill n Bass foretold the frenetic 64th note drum programming insanity and blitzed-out studio shenanigans of future IDM genres which would eventually become the scene's stereotype. That and the pretentiousness.

It's like IDM Animusic.(Autechre - Gantz Graf)
	

You might come across the odd throwback track here and there, but by and large this is a genre that only defined a scene in its infancy, when it was still trying to find itself and its purpose in life.
Ish.


## Glitch Hop
*aka:  Wonky* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in early 2000s

A lot of scenes abused the hell out of Glitch's ideas to invent more accessible (read: rhythmic and danceable) genres. Glitch decided that it wanted to do that too. With hookers, and blackjack. Actually, forget the blackjack.
This was probably a mistake because as soon as anything pretentious and nerdy grabs some street cred the frat festival scene muscles in and takes case ownership of it which fuels the most storied conflict in human cultures: Purists vs Poseurs (or Nativists vs Immigrants if you want to get political about it). Such are the perils of popularity.
Glitch Hop is Glitch aesthetics mixed with Hip Hop aesthetics. It can have rapping but that is not what makes it "Hip Hop". Rather, it's the employment of Hip Hop-style breaks fed through the filter of IDM's "destroy the breaks" mantra. In other words: It's Hop Hop breaks chopped, spliced, edited, bit-crushed, sampled, cut up, and mangled. So it's more in line with the Turntablism side of Hip Hop rather than the black-guys-talking-really-fast side.
Glitch Hop is one of the few genres that is often played live. And by live I mean with a laptop, a mixer, and a touchpad. Because when the goal is fucking up beats while not fucking up, there is nothing better than button-mashing on a touchpad. Go ahead, push the keys in any random order you want. It's all sequenced so it's impossible to make a mistake (this is IDM: All music in this scene sounds like a mistake).
But those aren't mistakes, they'll say. Those are unique revolutionary groundbreaking avant-garde forward-thinking neo-musical cutting edge explorations that we just can't comprehend. Or maybe it's just some wanker playing wack-a-mole with a bunch of glowing buttons.
There might be a rapper but who cares what they're bellyaching about when the DJ is going to town on that touchpad. It's like giving props for a guy's air guitar skills.
Oh man, what form! Look at him hit those buttons! I haven't seen such improvisation since the time Keith Emerson played a 16 hour keyboard solo with his elbows. Yeah, punch those keys! PUNCH THEM! HARDER!!! OMIGOD YOU'RE BLOWING MY FUCKING MIND WITH YOUR BUTTON PUNCHING! It's like the time I beat Blanka in Streetfighter II blindfolded.
As you can imagine, "Hip Hop" gave Glitch an chic attitude that IDM never really invested in before, making it by definition IDM's most popular genre.
DJs who might've started out spinning Nu Skool Breaks or Darkstep and wanted to stay relevant and up-to-date with the latest trends in electronic music for blitzed-out punters would pair this with Dubstep/Brostep belches and really angry, aggressive Filthy Electrohouse, making the genres together a sort of pseudo-scene that I would label "shitty skater bro" music.
You know, the kind of "good EDM" that you tell your friends you listen to but you don't want them to think you're a fag (pro tip: Get better friends if you're worried about that sort of thing).
IDM shuns this genre now because if there's one thing the pretentious white dorkness of IDM did not subscribe to, it's frat bro culture.
But Glitch Hop will not go away because anything that bridges the gap between the electrifying performance of the live rock band and the stilted non-showmanship of the DJ is destined to be with us forever, like SUVs or tablets: For people who need a hybrid consumer thing that has the convenience and utilities of two other things but not doing them very well.
Glitch Hop has probably split into many subgenres, the most famous of which is Wonky, another one of those typical UK genres fusing Glitch Hop + the Ketamine snorting theatrics of Dubstep. Yes, that's as dumb and as trendwhorish as it sounds.
Ish.


## Glitch
*aka:  Clicks & Cuts, Abstract, Experimental, IDM* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in early 2000s

You ever play one of those games where you make up words by dumping Scrabble tiles all over the floor and arranging the letters together in random patterns?
Well guess what: They make music like that.
Glitch is the least listenable genre not called Noise, Musique Concrete or Experimental. What do all these genres have in common? They're arhythmic, which means you cannot dance to them. You cannot really do anything to them because there's no beat (sorta), meter (kinda), or tempo (somewhat). It's just random sound effects hitting your ear.
Glitch already had its antecedants in CD and vinyl skipping errors and MP3 artifacts, and like Microhouse it decided that these bugs were actually features, specifically the CD skipping noises.
It's a level of reverse-is-true pretentiousness only appreciated by the art world. In much the same way someone might nail a pile of feces to a cork board and call it style nouveau (all art names must be in French), so too can musicians pretend the cantankerous noise they're making by feeding aluminum foil into a woodchipper or applying a cordless circular saw to an electic guitar constitutes as original, inventive, forward-thinking music.
Never underestimate the KLF's drive to explore new sonic territory.
Amazingly this aesthetic worked. Or it worked once commercially savvy producers took the sonic ideas and made them rhythmic, which is kind of a betrayal but not really. If you want total and complete noise, go to Noise for that.
In all honesty Glitch probably started out as a musical version of Poe's Law or The Emperor's New Clothes, to see how far one can push the stuffy pretentious elitists before they abandon you. Turns out there is no bottom -- they will rationalize their appreciation for anything as long as no one else appreciates it. Especially if no one else appreciates it.
It probably started out as a joke spearheaded by a German label with a French name (because of course it is) called Mille Plateaux and their seminal mix series Clicks_+_Cuts, which was so popular the genre was called Clicks & Cuts for awhile.
If you zoomed in on a CD, this is what you would see. Just kidding, CDs look like morse code. I don't know what this is.
It wasn't long before the aesthetics of Glitch, that is the ideas and techniques of Glitch but not the genre itself, caught on like a fire that is out of control and spreads really fast in a dry forest.
If the first decade of the 2000s can be characterized by any specific sound -- like how the walking bassline characterizes the 70s or the synthesizer riff characterizes the 80s -- it would be this specific technique of cutting, splicing, mangling, and glitching up music. But all rhythmically. Sort of.
(Also the horrendously abused stutter edit, but that was mostly James Zabiela and Ableton's fault. And to a lesser extent BT)
Every new genre that emerged for a decade afterward (and in some cases is still happening today), from Electrohouse to Filthy Electrohouse to Brostep to Drumstep to Tech House and all other genres of IDM, owe their aesthetics to Glitch. It has inadvertently become one of the most influential sound ideas of the 21st century. Nobody expected that to happen from such an acquired taste of a genre. I blame Vice Magazine.
Ironically, despite its massive influence Glitch hasn't produced many subgenres or post-genres itself. And just as well because Glitch works best in small doses and having to endure an entire scene of this stuff is a tiresome chore that not even the pompous pretentious pimple poppers will abide.
Ish.

# Pioneers

## Experimental
*aka:  Early electronic sounds* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in who knows

This is the origin of the Guide. If you're one of those obsessive-compulsive completist types who has to go through everything sequentially or chronologically -- like you just have to clear every square inch of the black area of the map before moving onto the next area in a video game -- this is a good place to start.
This is Experimental, the earliest electronic music genre if it can be called that. Technically all electronic music is Experimental until someone decides to call it something else and that's not going to happen without time, vision, and marketing. So we're in the clear here, at least for awhile.
For this guide Experimental starts out as its own thing and then gets absorbed into the IDM scene for no reason other than there's no reason for it not to (I'm sure the IDMiots won't mind).
The very early years of electronic music are compressed because almost nothing cool happens before 1950 except for a handful of sparsely miscellaneous breakthroughs so this scene -- the Pioneers -- tracks the gradual progression of electronic music over the first half of the twentieth century from science to art to recreation to commercial industry.
Here we see an early prototype of the first headphones, capable of listening to music that might theoretically exist sometime in the future. Or perhaps far away.
Experimental isn't a genre as much as it is a rejection of the status quo which in music's case can mean anything that doesn't sound like music. The early Experimental electronic phase is the earliest you're going to hear electronic sounds. You probably won't like most of it.
At the outset Experimental was mostly theoretical machine burps and belches and squeals and whines that you'd barely recognize as noise let alone music. It's more of a laboratory exercise than a genre; full of stuffy engineers and researchers trying to get electronic machines that could hardly be classified as computers to produce tones (with mixed results).
The goal was not to produce novel sounds but to develop unique ways to produce novel sounds. It was a challenge involving limitations just as much as it was a challenge involving creativity, much like the quest to get every digital device to run Doom. Fascinating but not for musical reasons (in other words: I am impressed that you got it to run on a Gameboy but I don't actually want to play it on a Gameboy).
What was the first ever published electronic music song? Hard to say. It all depends on what your definition of an electronic music song is. The origins of electronic music go back to before it was even music and no one really kept any good records at the time (probably because of the war).
Currently the earliest tracks on this guide are from 1937 but there are earlier examples of Theremin concertos which, while electronic, I would not classify as Experimental because the Theremin did a really good job pretending to not be electronic (in expert hands it could resemble a violin). That's just not avant-garde enough to be Experimental.
The Fathers of Electronic Music are here to show you how they do things oldskool.from left to right: Francois Bayle, Pierre Schaeffer, Bernard Parmegiani
In the early going the instruments that made electronic music were very expensive, very large, and not very user-friendly. But they did establish standards in sound design and interactivity that electronic gear by and large still obeys today.
All music is just sound waves, after all, and if you can get a digital circuit to produce one then you're already 90% of the way there. The rest is refinement and repetition.
Just don't expect the output to impress anyone.
Ish.


# Intelligent Dance Music

## Ambient Techno
*aka:  Intelligent Techno, IDM* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in early 90s

Ambient Techno is on its surface exactly what you'd expect: Ambient + Techno, only the union is twisted and deformed like it emerged from a Brundlefly pod.
In truth it is neither, in much the same way Mongolian Barbecue is actually Taiwanese Stir Fry. It basically exists because of Warp Records, but most specifically because of this album which ironically was not released on Warp:
If the subtitle is to be believed, that means Richard D. James composed his first tracks when he was 14, which is plausible considering he was building his own synthesizers at age 12. And he was shaving at age 10. And driving at age 8. And writing his memoirs at age 6. And running for office at age 4.
The name is a misnomer because no one really knew what to call it at the time. The droning ambient synths and lovely washed out pads were a given but the hyperactive breakbeats discluded it from the Ambient, Chill Out, Downtempo, and other miscellaneous laidback genre families. So what was it? Well, the new Techno sound was hyperactive so why not call it Ambient Techno? I'm sure that was the marketing that went on at the time. Marketers aren't known for their accuracy.
The name didn't really work so within a few years there was an attempt to brand Aphex Twin (and people trying to sound like Aphex Twin) "Intelligent Dance Music" which is an even worse name because it's not intelligent, it's not really for dancing, and in some instances may not even qualify as music. In much the same way rocky mountain oysters are neither rocky nor mountains nor oysters.
But the name stuck and the buzzword "intelligent" attracted the most stuffy of the chin-stroking pretentious elitists (the pre-hipsters hipsters. You probably haven't heard of them).
Warp Records took note of this new market of electronic music lovers who didn't necessarily want to dance nor listen to electronic music and released their Artificial Intelligence series which introduced the coffeehouse and dimly lit lounge crowd to Autechre, Biosphere, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Black Dog, and Polygon Window (aka Richard D. James).
Can you really build an entire scene off the works of one guy? What do you think Ambient is?
Ambient Techno probably should have remained a sub-genre of an existing scene, like an off-shoot of Bleep Techno since it was most prominant in the UK during the Rave Epoch. But as fate would have it those dorky Brit producers attracted dorky Brit followers that looked to take their dorky Brit music into ever dorkier, Brittier pastures. And with attention comes exploration, which leads to more genres and the inevitable nitpicking and fragmentation and splinter sounds and such as.
So then in come the crime scene investigators music journalists who try to make sense of the mess by putting together complex piles on the floor and drawing lines of relationship between them. And every now and again something is found that causes a new pile to be formed, and everything has to relate to it. Which is basically what I do.
And that's how Ambient Techno, or Intelligent Techno or whatever you want to call it, inexplicably gave birth to a whole new scene with the worst name in electronic music.
Ambient Techno is still around today because every generation discovers Selected Ambient Works for the first time and then wants to make music like that.
Ish.


## Braindance
*aka:  IDM* in the Intelligent Dance Music scene, emerged in mid 90s

Braindance is electronic music that tries to fuck with your brain rather than appeal to it.
The biggest selling point in Braindance is that it does not like being locked into the 4/4 quarter note 16-step sequenced groove that comprises almost all electronic music (and by almost I mean like 99.98%).
Braindance breaks from tradition in that it tries to break from being listenable music entirely. It eschews the perfect, machinelike digital quantization found around the electronic music world and introduces Frank Zappa-like unfriendly unmusic unexplorations.
So you might hear bizarre time signatures like 9/13, avant-garde scales like Archytas' Enharmonic 8-tone scale or the 19-equal scale or Harry Partch's really fucked up 43-tone scale which sounds practically atonal to the western ear and completely out of sync if you try to count the measures in multiples of 4. On top of that are circuit-bending effects, flange abuse, and dumb samples.
Braindance comes from Ambient Techno proper, and initially consisted of Warp Records afficianados who want to make music that sounds like Aphex Twin - Flim.
Over time, it became the go-to genre for anyone trying to break their drum machine or use their cat as a musical instrument which isn't a bad idea if random drum patterns are your goal. If there isn't already, there should be a song called "Cat-like Typing Detected". That one's free, producers. Make it happen.
Braindance is not music for dancing, befitting the irony of a scene called "Intelligent Dance Music" where none of its genres are danceable (and some aren't even intelligent). Well you can try, but you'd look really silly doing it. Ketamine might help.
The rest of it is for chin-stroking cafes or late night lofts and gatherings for hipsters urgently trying to find a form of music that no one has heard of much less enjoy, while they wear obscure soccer jerseys from some 4th division African club league.
BOTSWANA MEAT COMMISSION FC ROOLZ!
As with most things in IDM and even electronic music in general, things that once sounded weird, avant-garde and offputting were inevitably normalized. Bizarre soundscapes and drum patterns that were the hallmark of IDM in the 90s became commonplace in pop culture 10 years later.

And when I say commonplace I mean it's the background music in forensics montages in CSI episodes. That's how normal this scene has become.
	

What is IDM to do when the mainstream keeps encroaching on its territory like that? Same thing every other genre does: Move on. To be underground is to be in a state of constant digging. You cannot be stagnant forever. Evolve or perish.
Ish.


# Pioneers

## Musique Concrete
*aka:  Acousmatic music, Elektronische Musik* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in early 40s

Musique Concrete was an attempt to make new sounds from existing sounds. Note that I said sounds, not music.
Electronic music has always been rife with experimentation and scientific curiosity. One of the more important developments to new music and sound in the early 20th century was the advent of recorded media. Theorists speculated as far back as the 1920s that usage of the gramaphone and radio could be used to create new compositions, as a forerunner to sampling. And that is precisely what some stuffy chainsmoking French intellectuals had in mind but unfortunately they had to wait awhile to put their ideas into practice. France was not a pleasant place in the first half of the twentieth century.
The first dude to explore this new frontier was probably Pierre Schaeffer and his Studio d'Essai in Paris in 1942, which was originally used as a broadcast center for the French resistance against the Nazis.
Pierre Schaeffer doing something.
Schaeffer cut his teeth on the radio technology of the day, learning how to scramble signals and experiment with different frequencies and bands, and it was this education -- warfare radioworks -- that allowed him to develop it into... I hesitate to call it music, but he certainly applied what he learned after the war.
The idea behind Schaeffer's "concrete music" was that it was built on sounds that already existed. The sounds were fixed recordings, and the value of the "music" was not in its output but rather in the new forms of composition that went into its input. It is literally music for technologists who fail to see the point to music. Like a guy who doesn't like blistering guitar solos, he just likes to see guitarists move their hands up and down the frets really fast.
Musique Concrete eschewed traditional forms of music and structure, abandoning important things like melody and rhythm. It utilized the random sounds of every day life from walking on cement to drilling through cement to mixing cement. The instruments used (if you can call them instruments) were the technological recording tools themselves: Record players (especially ones that could play in reverse), microphones, phonographs, magnetic tape recorders, and primitive sampling and looping methods.
Naturally this attracted the most insufferable of the French art scene like the futurists, dadaists, existentialists, and beats, all of whom never understand the point to music either and all of whom helped found post-modernism ("Weird for the sake of weird", to quote Moe Szyslak from The Simpsons) along with some other wacky art movements.
Musique Concrete is one of the few genres that in its original essence doesn't exist anymore because it can't exist, not because the artform is dead or that no one is interested in it, but because the original tools to make it are extinct. It would be like trying to make a VHS movie 50 years from now, long after the format has been discontinued and the knowledge to make it has passed out of memory.
But Musique Concrete's aesthetics live on in successor genres, especially Industrial and Collage, both of which employ structure and rhythm (and a point) to Musique Concrete to make it more accessible. Because let's be fair: This stuff is just plain awful.
And I'm sure that's the way the French purists like it.

## Minimalism
*aka:  Minimal music* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in late 60s

Minimalism (not to be confused with the art movement Minimalism and only a specious relationship with Minimal Techno, Minimal Tech, or Minimal Prog) is the savant of music.
If Musique Concrete was the random, atonal, unrhythmic explorations of new recording technologies, Minimalism was its polar opposite: Real instruments in little phrases and iterations, looping incessantly, ceaselessly, without end, like an autistic child rocking back and forth or like a raver with their eyes rolled in the back of their head swaying to and fro.
The real genius of Minimalism is its gradual drifting into new phrases and patterns slowly over time, so slowly that you may not notice it. Despite being basic and repetitive Minimalism is a genre that challenges you to pay attention and rewards you for it.
Technically Minimalism is the aesthetic godfather of all electronic music. It introduces structure, rhythm, timbre, and an earnest repetitiveness that is offputting to anyone not used to music that doesn't fit the verse-bridge-chorus template. Even today, 50 years later, Techno and Tech House are still adhering to the basic theories introduced by Minimalism, and are filling clubs and festivals with it. We all love hypnotic, repetitive music. That's what makes it music.
Minimalism is more famous than you might think. It serves as excellent existential mood music, as in the wordless art documentaries of Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke:


If it sounds familiar, it's Doctor Manhattan's origin story in Watchmen. And Hans Zimmer ripped it off for Interstellar.(Philip Glass - Prophecies)
	

Minimalism represents order, structure, progression, anticipation. The counter to that -- those that hate Minimalism and repetition -- is chaos, unpredictability, randomness. There is nothing wrong with wanting that in your music but generally people don't like it and will never like it and I'll tell you why.
Human anxiety comes from trepidation about the future. We are hard-wired to anticipate future events and one of the strongest human fears is uncertainty about what happens next. When things change, it is a common tendency to resist these changes. We cannot anticipate the dangers the changes may bring us. We develop false positives -- superstitions -- in an attempt to bring order to chaos, because what we can control cannot hurt us.
(This explains also the popularity of gambling: It taps into the underlying thrill of not being able to predict the outcome. Like horror movies and roller coasters, we enjoy indulging our fears on a superficial level)
Minimalism is a gift from evolution for the aggressive pattern-seeker species. We enjoy Minimalism and we don't know why, and that is because the alternative invites suffering, misery, confusion, and death.

## Krautrock
*aka:  Kosmische Musik, Berlin School* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in late 60s

Krautrock is electronic music that came out of Germany in the 1970s. The term is not a pejorative.
There is a story to this. 1945 was an important year in German history (Japan too but let's stay focused here). The entire country was split into four zones of control by the Allies. Harsh restrictions were levied on the German people to prevent them from starting another World War and one of these restrictions was the abolishment of Prussia as a political entity.
It was old Prussian militarism that the Allies saw as the prime motivating force behind the grotesque wars of the twentieth century, so they decreed that such a culture be forbidden from existing ever again. Just like that a once proud Baltic heritage was wiped clean out of history.
Yeah, no more of this sort of thing. You make automobiles and pharmaceuticals for now on.
The generation of Germans who grew up in the post war period learned not to look back at their past, it being full of so much suffering and war and the western countries rubbing it in their faces all the time, like sticking a dog's nose in its own poop to teach it not to make a mess in the house. For post-war Germans their heritage was something to be ashamed of. They couldn't look back. They had to look forward. 1945 was year 0.
So instead Germany looked to the future to new ideas, new cultural attitudes, and a new European order that would see them become leaders and builders again, and make right all the wrongs they had committed. The German attitude was not to honor the ancient traditions but to create new traditions in all aspects of society: Art, culture, industry.... and especially music.
So while Boomer children in Britain and USA launched a music revolution in the 60s influenced by their traditions in Soul, Gospel, Folk, Blues, Jazz and Rock n Roll, youth in Germany looked to the future, to create a new musical identity rather than one influenced by the past. This meant brash experimentation and fearless adoption of new musical technologies, including sythesizers and fuzz boxes.
By the 70s a lot of interesting music was coming out of West Germany that British music writers couldn't make sense of. They called it Krautrock which was initially a dismissive term and which the German musicians themselves didn't like but they couldn't come up with an agreeable substitution so over the years the term stuck and it also lost its derogatory connotations.
Krautrock legends Can have the honor of being the worst named music group for search engine results.
Krautrock is a unique blend of hazy 60s psychedelic rock, avant-garde French experimentalism, jazz improvisation and spacey dreamscapes that went on forever. It is Pink Floyd on Quaaludes, with more sound effects and less guitar solos. The artists who established the Krautrock template like Tangerine Dream still tour today with much of the same setup.
Yes, Kraftwerk was considered Krautrock at one time too, but that's only up until Autobahn. Then they went off into their own special brand of Technopop.
Krautrock is still around today as the Berlin School (not to be confused with the Berliner sound of Minimal Tech), making Krautrock probably the longest, most contiguous and consistent genre in all of electronic music.
In over 45 years of history Krautrock has never deviated from its aesthetics or core sound. The production values may have changed but a Krautrock song from 2016 sounds right at home alongside a Krautrock song from 1971.
And we wouldn't expect anything else from those industriously consistent Germans.
Ish.


## Modern Classical
*aka:  Contemporary Classical, Postmodern Classical* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in maybe the 40s

Modern Classical is electronic music utilizing classical scales, movements, forms and tempos (ie: no sequencers). Or it's classical music with a wiggle box in the back, who knows. But it's not some dodgy Eurotrance bollocks with a Chopin or Debussy sample (or worse yet, Samuel Barber). Just to set things straight.
The advancement of music technology was never ignored by the traditional world of composers, performers and purveyors of what the snobs would call "real instruments". In fact, many classical composers lauded the new paradigms gifted them by technological progress. Music was never much up for the raging sperglord debates of what constitutes real music like acoustic vs electric, analog vs digital, or playing vs programming despite how protective some purists are of their super seriously important musical identities.
Like this guy. Don't be this guy.(that's not to say there isn't bad music out there. Just don't call it "not music")
Anyone who actually cares about music and the direction it's headed are doing themselves a discredit for not taking advantage of new forms and new opportunities when they arise. You can't halt progress. In a hundred years robots are going to be composing all our music for us anyway and there's nothing we can do to stop that. Might as well enjoy "that which is" rather than complain about "that which isn't" (or shouldn't be). Music evolves. You must evolve with it.
The early genres of Musique Concrete and Minimalism were considered part of the classical canon and at one point heralded a shift from the modern period to the post-modern period until Classical decided they were their own thing and not actually Classical. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its own forerunners.
Perhaps the first merging of an orchestra with something somewhat electronic (but not really) is this:

Before T-Pain, before Daft Punk, before Zapp, before Neil Young, before Pete Frampton, there was this. Also: Everyone in this clip is now dead. Even the dog.
	

Talkboxes and voiceboxes had existed back in the 1930s since everyone smoked back then and larynx surgery was a thing. But there was a barrier to using actual electronic instruments in orchestras due to the immense size and unreliability of the machines. It wouldn't be until the 70s that synthesizers actually got small enough to actually be carried much less performed in live settings.
And by then, Modern Classical had inspired the New Age and Ambient movements, where composers were constructing entire symphonies out of electronic instruments as opposed to accentuating live performances with them.
That doesn't make this category redundant but there is a lot of bleeding/crossover material that works in either scene.
Ish.


## Soundtrack
*aka:  Theme music, background music, filler music, library music* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in early 50s, most likely

Soundtrack music is electronic music used in movies, television shows, commercials, and other media. It differs from other genres in that the music is not an end in itself but rather a means to promote another medium.
This genre is not about needle drops in movies. It is about original electronic scores for movies, some of them not released in any other format yet over time have became more fascinating than whatever commercial property they were attached to. Well, not always.
Sometimes the music was dodgy uninspired junk eeked out in a lazy Sunday afternoon on an Oberheim OB-Xa. Other times the music was far too good for its intended use and it deserves more recognition.
Electronic music has a rich history with the movies. The first movie to use an all-electronic score, with no acoustic accompaniment whatsoever, was the sci-fi classic Forbidden Planet in 1956.

The most amazing thing about this movie is that Leslie Nielsen at one time did not have white hair.
	

The soundtrack was so alien, so weird, and so atonal that the Academy didn't even consider it music. For this reason the composers Louis and Bebe Barron did not get a scoring credit. Rather they were credited with creating the "electronic tonalities" and they were therefore ineligible for an Oscar (in either scoring or special effects) on that stupid technicality alone.
That's not the best way to win an Oscar anyway. If you want to win an Academy Award, just make a black & white Shakespearean biopic based on a true story about a mentally disabled gay slave with AIDS who tries to make it big in Hollywood by speaking out against racism during the Holocaust. Get Tom Hanks and Daniel Day Lewis on board and you will clean up come Oscar time.
Science fiction is the perfect vehicle for electronic music soundscapes and atmospherics. The alien invasion b-films of the 50s abused the Theremin so much it became cliche. After the release of 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968, there was a brief period where science fiction movies stopped being cheap rubber suit monsters and rockets on strings hovering around styrofoam planets, and started being about grim dystopias and the eerie emptiness of space.
Intellectual sci-fi films like Silent Running, Soylent Green, Rollerball, Logan's Run, Solaris, Planet of the Apes, Westworld, Omega Man, Andromeda Strain, Demon Seed, THX 1138, and A Clockwork Orange (to name a few in my collection) took advantage of electronic music's haunting depersonalization and cold, mechanical feel (except for the ones that didn't). Of course this sci-fi golden period ended with Star Wars, which returned things to the Flash Gordon era of pew pew lasers and explosions, and bombastic operatic scores.
In the 80s some of the most memorable movie scores were fully electronic (The Terminator, Transformers, Chariots of Fire), and that was during the age of the Big Five Hollywood orchestral composers (Williams, Horner, Silvestri, Shore, Goldsmith...and I guess Elfman is a sixth). That's not a thing anymore since some of them are dead (and Alan Silvestri was the only composer who dabbled in everything -- dude scored Flight of the Navigator the same year he scored Back To The Future. Now that's versatility).
Today a lot of electronic producers have turned to films such as Junkie XL (he'll always be a Nu Skool Breaks punter to me), Clint Mansell, Trent Reznor, even Hans Zimmer got his start as a Synthpop keyboardist for hire.
Electronic music also had a big hand in library/production music, especially when equipment became cheaper than hiring session musicians. Library music is the stock music collections that license music for use in television and commercials (and porn). A lot of media companies operating on a budget rely heavily on library music for their productions.

Not electronic, but I discovered this on a library music catalogue released in 1976.Is it me or did Pink Floyd rip this off for Run Like Hell?
	

Library music is sometimes hard to procure because it tends to lay dormant in broadcast station vaults most of the time, right beside the Ark of the Covenant. But occasionally some labels will get up the nerve to compile it in a consummable product and release it to the public.
With no quality control a lot of library music is pointless dreck (most of it is miscellaneous royalty free jingles, noodlings and songlets used to fill background silence and not actually meant to be paid attention to), but there are some gems here and there if you have the patience to sift through a thousand hours of music just to find a catchy 40 second jingle. Hey, that's how Boards of Canada got their start.
Electronic music has a very influential history with television. The best theme songs from Doctor Who to Knight Rider were all electronic (suck it Dukes of Hazzard).
And then there was Miami Vice, a television score so popular it was released as an album, sold 4 million copies, remained on the Billboard charts for over two years and spawned four sequels. The secret was Jan Hammer's use of the Fairlight CMI, and being good friends with John Tesh back when Tesh was host of Entertainment Tonight:

While it looks impressive, keep in mind the Fairlight cost $65,000 in 1983 dollars. Jan Hammer used one because he had that Miami Vice fuck you money.
	

Electronic music also has a history as an innovator of children's music. Children love interesting and weird sounds, and electronic music's unique palette was a perfect fit for circus music, carnival rides, and educational media and learning tools.
Although not technically an electronic instrument, Texas Instrument's Speak & Spell, an educational toy that taught kids how to read in the early 80s, was a sought after device for Live PAs for its robot voice able to say any generic word or at least spell it out (even the naughty ones), like a pseudo vocoder.
The best use of it at parties was to simply hit the "E" key over and over again. Or "M D M A".
And last but not least: Electronic music has a legendary history with video games. So big in fact that it is a scene onto itself: Chiptune.
Yes, it's all here. All the electronic music that wasn't meant for electronic music. Even Harold Faltermeyer.
Ish.


## Moog
*aka:  Synth music* in the Pioneers scene, emerged in mid 60s

Moog music is music made with Moog. It's also music made by Moog. And it's the only music named after Moog.
What is Moog? This is Moog:
The Moog Modular, released 1964.
The Moog Modular was the first synthesizer that was actually smaller than a room. You didn't have to buy all the modules but if you wanted to have different waveforms, amplifiers, oscillators, filters, etc. it was necessary to get most of them.
You could custom configure the Moog Modular with any array of modules that you wanted and for some enthusiasts that was more fun than actually making music. It's like building custom Magic: The Gathering decks but never actually duelling with them. But most people probably just bought a few of the more popular stock design models. Because sometimes having too many choices is a bad thing. I mean, just look at all those dials, knobs, and 1/4" jacks and plugs.
The Moog Modular puttered around for a few years with lacklustre sales until a young enthusiastic customer not only bought all the modules but took them apart and tinkered with them and wrote back to Moog, suggesting ways to improve envelopes or fixed filter banks or other electronics nuttery.
Moog took Wendy's suggestions under advisement and they became great friends. Wendy built her own studio and expressed a desire to demonstrate the worthiness of the Moog by replicating the works of Johann Sebastian Bach which is pretty ambitious considering Bach's music was chamber/orchestral and the Moog was monophonic. Nevertheless, the gamble paid off and the result sold over a million copies, primarily as a novelty:
Because if electronic music is going to be accessible, it first has to be recognizably familiar, and what better way to do that then Baroque covers.
I'll let Robert himself explain what happened next, with an excerpt from Vintage Synthesizers: "But when Switched-On Bach came out, the shit hit the fan. All the record producers had to have their Moog record for 1969. We got orders from CBS, NBC, Elektra, a lot of other guys. And these guys didn't want just 'one of this, and two of that....' They said, 'Give me your biggest system,' and they expected to make money like Carlos did. I could play you some of these records. A few of them still stand up. But mostly they were cynical, inept, opportunistic things: Throw together a group, lay down some strings and horns and vocals, leave some space for a novelty melody line from the synth. That was the scene in 69. Moog records."
Whether anyone had intended it or not, the popularity of Carlos' novelty hit had inadvertently launched an entire genre based around this one device, and of course no one was using it properly. It wouldn't be the first time this would happen in electronic music (see: 303 for Acid, or Amen Break for Ragga Jungle). Whenever something gets big, out come the copycats and cheap imitations trying to capitalize on its success.
The money Moog made from people wanting to make shitty Moog music gave him the freedom to build other synthesizers, and with increases in technology and decreases in size, in 1971 Moog released a portable version of his popular Modular synthesizer only without all the mods and patches and cords and other junk: The Minimoog.
What a miniature Moog might look like.
Such a portable device found a captive audience in Progressive Rock keyboardists who were always eager to find new ways to bore their audiences with noodly, meandering 16 hour solos. This is why Pink Floyd didn't start becoming a listenable live band until they could take their studio sound effects gizmos on tour with them. I'll let Rick Wakeman hilariously explain to Bob Moog his first encounter with a Minimoog:

What two music legends shooting the shit sounds like.
	

While the Minimoog held interest for some time, by the mid 70s other synth manufacturers with far deeper pockets than Moog -- including Arp, Yamaha, Roland, Korg and dozens more -- had joined the game, crowding Moog's already limited marketshare.
The Moog fell out of use when newer, better, and smaller synths hit the market but for a brief period in the 60s popular electronic music was Moogian because that's quite simply all there was.
Ish.

# Chiptune

## Plus
*aka:  Seapunk, Nintendocore, Skweee, Chipcore, Chip Rock, Chip Metal, Chipwave Chip Hop, Chipstep, Chip House, Chipbient, Chip Bass* in the Chiptune scene, emerged in late 80s

Plus is any Chiptune music that uses additional instrumentation that does not come from Chiptune (hence Chiptune Plus something else).
That would include but is not limited to: Seapunk, Nintendocore, Chip IDM, Chip Rock, Chip Metal, Chipwave, Chip Hop, Chipstep, Chip House, Chipbient, Chip Bass, Chip Dip, Rocketchip, Blue Chip, Potato Chip, Poker Chip, Chocolate Chip, Chippendale, and of course California Highway Patrol.
Any live band that uses Chiptune sounds -- that's Plus. Any Electrohouse track that has Mario sound effects -- that's Plus. Any Chiptune with a drum break -- that's Plus. Any Chiptune with vocals -- that's Plus. Especially if its Nerdcore.
Beck - Girl is Plus. Yellow Magic Orchestra - Computer Games and Power-Pill - Pac-Man are technically Plus. And yes, Nelly Furtado - Do It is Plus. There was a big kerfuffle about that one so let's talk about it.
Basically, Timbaland (Nelly Furtado's producer) sampled a Chiptune song without giving any credit and he thought he could get away with it.
The original song is AciDJazzed Evening by Finnish demoscene producer Janne Suni, made back in 2000 for a demoparty compo under the alias Tempest (go read Amiga/Tracker if you have no idea what I'm talking about). Timbaland denies it, of course. You can listen for yourself and be the judge:

It's actually GRG's C64 2002 remix that Timbaland directly sampled.
	

The demoscene is a very non-commercial community. Like Linux distros, demo music is provided freely and openly under the GNU public license (naturally). That doesn't mean the music is free to be used, sampled or remixed, nor does it mean its copyrights are not protected. Most demo producers would be happy to give permission for use of their music as long as its not used commercially. Don't make money off their shit and they won't DDOS your dog's wi-fi.
Now, I'm liable to believe Timbaland when he says that he didn't know where he got the sample from. Producers pilfer and catalogue sounds from all sorts of sources without really keeping track of who owns what, and its entirely possible that he just happened upon a large cache of SID files from some demo archive and he picked an interesting one to use as a rhythm track.
Whether Timbaland was aware that this music was public domain or copyrighted, he probably didn't care. He's Timbaland. He can worry about the legal issues later and there was a remote chance that there would be any. After all, how often does the pop music world hear from the demoscene guys? It's an honest risk assessment.
As luck would have it the demoscene did notice. And they were mad. So the copyright infringement case went to court both in America and Finland and of course Timbaland won. Because it's okay for the bigname R&B producer to rip off the underground artist but not vice versa.
Go ahead, rip off some underground scene and sell it as something you invented (Madonna has been doing that for 40 years), but if you so much as lift one Michael Jackson vocal tic you'll fight an army of lawyers for the rest of your life. Make no mistake: We do not have a justice system. We have a legality market.
This issue could have been avoided if Timbaland just released the song for free. Or at least credited Mr. Sunni in the liner notes.
Back to Plus: Most recently a lot of Plus music has been taking on Dubstep and IDM influences (especially Breakcore, giving us Chipcore), probably because it represents a challenge in sound design for Chiptune composers. Or maybe they are secret pretentious elitists too. Well of course they are -- they program in Assembler for crying out loud.
Ish.


## Fakebit
*aka:  9-Bit, Riptune, Chiptune-inspired* in the Chiptune scene, emerged in late 80s

Fakebit, otherwise known as Riptune or 9-bit is any Chiptune music that either goes beyond the limitations of the original soundchips or eschews them entirely in favor of samples, emulators, converters or other tech shortcuts. This is considered cheating.
A lot of Fakebit simply has too many channels or chorus/reverb to be the genuine thing. That still makes it inauthentic. If the music is not made on the original hardware, it's considered non-authentic Chiptune or "Chiptune inspired". Even using a tracker is extremely frowned upon (depending on how it's used), if not outright forbidden. Don't ask why, but this matters a lot to some people. Purity is everything in the world of Chiptune.
Fakebit as a portmanteau can either be a pejorative, derogatory, offensive, or it can be totally insulting. How you choose to see it is entirely up to you. But most Fakebit composers are not working with the original chips and don't care -- they just want to make fun video game songs and they can't be bothered with the limitations and arcane baggage that comes with working with 40 year old microchip technology.
Sometimes the creators themselves don't know if a track is Fakebit but will label it Chiptune nonetheless. That really rustles the jimmies of the purists. You don't have to care about any of this. After all, the most important thing is whether the song is any good.

An example of good Fakebit: Golden Shower - Video Computer System. No Atari could play this but it's a great song (and video) nonetheless.
	

But there is a valid argument against the lazy, ignorant neophyte composers who don't even try to make their chiptunes sound authentic. The worst offenders are the Riptuners who might sit down at a DAW and rev up 47 channels of square waves and white noise, bitcrushed samples, and tons of chorus, echo and reverb to shart something that would absolutely choke to death any system, new or old, that would try to play it.
The most despicable Riptunes are the ones that aren't even composed but rather fed through a MIDI conversion program like GXSCC. Youtube is full of terrible Chiptune covers of rock, metal and pop songs that were nothing more than someone feeding a MIDI file into GXSCC and uploading the output. Sounds like this:

Metallica - Master of Puppets, the Riptune cover.James Hetfield has never sounded better.
	

There should be a line drawn somewhere when it comes to bullshit copycat hack jobs. Allowing this nonsense to proliferate cheapens an already sordid and suspect genre. You won't be hearing this at MAGFest.
Speaking of video game covers, I should probably mention that the music on ocremix is not Fakebit. It's not any bit.
OCR is an excellent resource of remixes, covers, and unique arrangements of popular video game themes. Almost never are these arrangements Chiptune nor are they trying to be (some might be Plus). I wouldn't even call them electronic music although most of them are constructed through digital workstations (without trying to sound like they are -- orchestral and rock seem to be the most popular arrangement styles). But making Chiptune music is not what they are trying to do.
Some Fakebit is easier to spot than others. I'm not expecting you to tell the difference right away (I can't even tell the difference most of the time). It's just something you need to have an ear for which is easier if you have intimate knowledge of a given sound chip's limitations and you know what technical specification the song just violated at a glance. It's like wine: You probably can't tell the difference between a $10 bottle and a $500 bottle either, but connoisseurs can because they drink it regularly, they ferment their own, and they attend conferences, taste forums, contests and awards shows, and they partake in wine culture, wine literature and wine living. If you do all this too, eventually you will develop a discerning taste for what's good wine.
Appreciation of anything on a pertinent qualitative level requires a sufficient amount of knowledge and experience. You'll never get there unless you expose yourself to a lot of it first. I guess what I'm trying to say is: Go listen to a million Chiptune tracks to get a feel for what is Fakebit. Only then will you understand why this matters. In fact, just go do that for every genre. You'll appreciate this guide more.
Fakebit has only increased in popularity as the barrier to entry in making Chiptune-sounding music has gotten lower and noobs have no patience nor interest nor love for making music the right way. The purists have a right to complain about this but at the same time you can't expect technology to freeze art forever. That's not the way it works.
Ish.



## Amiga/Tracker
*aka:  Amiga, Tracker, Keygen, Cracktro, Demo music, MOD music, SID music, warez music* in the Chiptune scene, emerged in late 80s

Amiga/Tracker is the Chiptune genre that is not a Chiptune genre (or even a regular genre, technically). Let me explain.
First, the Amiga part refers to the Amiga series of home computer systems released by Commodore in 1985 and lasting well into the 90s. It was a Macintosh clone that fought other Macintosh clones (chiefly the Atari ST) for supreme Macintosh clone dominance. Ironically its strengths were not in music but in video production and editing, especially in screen effects, chromakey, overlays and graphics for use in broadcast television. It was one of the first home computers that could render 3D animation and if it stuck to its niche and Commodore hadn't mismanaged it to death it could have survived the computer format wars of the 80s.
What an Amiga might look like.
While the Amiga does have a 4-channel sound chip with a thankfully easy to remember name, its PAULA chip does not do synthesis of any kind. All authentic Chiptunes generate sounds via onboard wave generators but the PAULA chip only has 8-bit PCM channels which means it has no native sounds. The sounds are provided by small module files or MODs on the floppy disk, and the samples can be swapped in and out on the fly, effectively making the music sound like anything you want. Even other sound chips. Especially other sound chips.
Because of this the Amiga could be used to sample and emulate PSG chips (especially the C64, the Amiga's cousin), helping home users make Chiptune music in the days before there were any user-friendly interfaces for doing so.
(The Super Nintendo's peculiar S-SMP chip behaved in much the same way except it had 8 channels and its samples could not be swapped. But the extra room allowed for faux-orchestral richness and more realistic sounding strings and trumpets which is why Super Nintendo music is popular but Super Nintendo chiptunes are not).
Things really helped with the release of Ultimate Soundtracker by Karsten Obarski (a name you don't have to know because I'll never mention him again), which was basically a 4-channel visual sequencer that took control of the PAULA chip's functions and instructed it how to play music. This was the first tracker. Now musicians could program Chiptune music without needing to know anything about the hardware or even learning a single line of code (though it helps).
Before trackers you had to write the notes out manually. By hand. In hexadecimal. While walking 20 miles through the snow uphill both ways. Blindfolded. And barefoot. And being chased by a pack of wolverines.
Today there are dozens of trackers and to keep it real some of them restrict things to the same 4-channel 8-bit PCM limitations of the original PAULA chip, but of course they don't have to. With software anything is possible. The only limit is yourself.
Trackers are just music sequencers that load, texturize and play sample snippets to coded parameters. They are not really beholden to the Amiga, to Amiga music, or really to any genre. And they can have as many channels as they want (Impulse Tracker could contain up to 64). Here's a track playing 17 channels:

These things are mesmerizing to watch live. With the composer on stage just totally shredding on them like super hardcore.
	

Because they use samples, trackers can sound like anything, even other electronic music genres and quite convincingly so (some of the best 90s Trance was produced through trackers and you probably couldn't tell). And tracker music was of course used in video games (Star Control II and the shareware games of Epic Megagames relied heavily on tracker-based freeware music).
In the pre-Internet era tracker files were the predominant way that people shared electronic music. Before MP3s and Napster, there was the Kosmic Free Music Foundation, a now defunct community of tracker enthusiasts who freely shared their creativity like pogs. I once had a huge archive of Kosmic music but it was lost in the Great Hard Drive Crash of 2001. All that music is now lost, like tears... in rain.
whoops wrong movie.
Its because of trackers that Chiptune broke away from video games to become its own thing. But there was one other group of people who helped untether Chiptune from its VGM ties. Of course you know I'm talking about.... Angelina Jolie hackers nerds.
Somewhere within the bowels of the Earth there is a secret society of nerds. I wouldn't call them unwashed, bespeckled socially awkward stereotypes who live in their mom's basements because those are geeks.
There is a difference: Nerds are useful -- they are engineers and scientists. They build integrated circuits and write software. Geeks are useless -- they are baristas and customer service agents. They build lego AT-ATs and write My Little Pony fan fiction. They can be further separated into subgenres of Dorks, Dweebs, Anoraks and Otakus, but that's an inane digression out of the scope of this guide.
These nerds got their start learning Assembler so they can talk to computer hardware more intimately in order to produce demos -- non-interactive audio/visual demonstrations for trade shows and computer store attractions (think Windows 95 screensavers or Winamp visualizer plugins).
The people who make these demos are part of a scene called the demoscene and they occasionally get together to throw demoparties or compos -- competitions to see who can make the best demos. Because humans will compete over anything.
A LAN demoparty. This is the penultimate nadir of the dorksphere, second only to Rush concerts.For a fun Where's Waldo game, see if you can find the one girl.
Demos are small enough to fit on a floppy disk yet impressive enough to procedurally generate 3D graphics on the fly. Since the graphics processing is handled by the CPU, the real challenge of demos isn't in the artistic creativity but rather in pushing the limits of the computer's raw computational cycles.
Demos were an easy way to procedurally generate 3D graphics in non-deterministic random patterns algorithmically and automatically, and they can go on forever which made them perfect for all-night (or all-weekend) visuals at raves back in the 90s.
Sometimes the demo visuals were more interesting than the actual music. If you're intrigued, go ahead and youtube demoscene visuals, there's all sorts of them out there. Here is an example of one:

This wasn't made with animation software. It was made with 64kb of math. And a 4kb tracker file."When Silence Dims The Stars Above" by Conspiracy, winning entry of the Revision 2018 demoparty. 
	

As computers became more powerful the need for demos declined commercially but their usage lives on as "cracktros" -- short audiovisual intros in pirated software that boast the hacker's exploits (because there's nothing hackers love more than bragging to other hackers that they are hackers). In time this became known as "keygen" music because broke-ass college students only heard this music when torrenting a pirated copy of Photoshop or Starcraft.
Now with all that said, what is this genre doing here if it's not really a genre? If the Amiga doesn't technically have any native sound and trackers can use any sound they want, then what does the music in this particular genre sound like and how does it differ from other genres? And how can you tell the difference?
This is going to sound like a copout, but over the years the Amiga did develop a dedicated bank of stereotypical sounds that I can only classify as "Amiga-y". The lo-fi grainyness of 8-bit PCM samples make it sound dated, retro, bitcrushed, slightly FM, and very reminiscent of synth-heavy 80s genres like Spacesynth (a lot of Spacesynth is tracker music anyway), Synthwave and New Age/Ambient. A good example of this is Animusic's MIDI-rendered computer animated music videos.

This wasn't made with animation software either. Well it was, but it was generated by the music.
	

Amiga and Tracker music lives on today and is more popular than ever but the vast majority of it is not used to faithfully reproduce the old soundchips. Instead, Trackers are mostly used to pillage old Chiptune sounds for use in new compositions, which is why most of the modern stuff more appropriately fits in with Fakebit and Plus, the two non-Chiptune Chiptune genres.
Ish.



## Chiptune
*aka:  PSG, Programmable Sound Generator, 8-Bit, VGM, NES, C64, Atari, Colecovision, Intellivision, MSX, Vectrex, Gameboy, Sega Master System, PC Speaker, Turbografx 16* in the Chiptune scene, emerged in late 70s

Chiptune is music made by computer chips. Specifically Programmable Sound Generator chips.
Technically all electronic music is made by computer chips but Chiptune is super serious about the whole process of how the music is made rather than the merits of the music itself (a lot of genres do that but none care about it more than Chiptune, with the possible exception of Turntablism).
Specifically, Chiptune worships certain classes of PSG chips and it is fiercely devoted to their limitations and parameters. This, above all, is what matters most to the Chiptune scene -- that you make the music the right way. The genres (and subgenres, and microgenres) of Chiptune are obsessed with separating the authentic Chiptunes (PSG, FM, and Amiga/Tracker) from the inauthentic Chiptunes (Fakebit, Plus, and Amiga/Tracker... it's complicated).
What does a PSG chip look like? Well, like this:
The infamous AY-3-8910 chip, responsible for most early arcade games like Frogger, Burger Time, Dragon's Lair, and home consoles like Intellivision, ZX Spectrum, Vectrex and Atari ST. Ain't she a beauty?
I won't go into the business of how these little chips produce sound (the answer is extremely long, technical and dorky), but it's important to understand that in the 70s and 80s digital audio was too large to be directly saved to memory and too demanding on the computer's CPU to even play.
Computers were like Rainman back then: Smart, but socially dysfunctional. Sure they can Visicalc your taxes but just try to get them to appreciate Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1 Allegro Non Troppo in B-flat minor Op.23 in PC speaker and they crash like a bitch (you think I'm joking but this actually happened to me. The entire movement, note by note in GW-BASIC. Hundreds of man hours lost).
The solution was to install these PSG ROM chips on the motherboard. Their onboard waveform generators took care of the size problem while their additional cycles processed the audio and relieved stress on the CPU, freeing it up to pursue other things like not dying of dysentery or looking for Sarah Connor. The chips themselves contained the actual sounds. The cartridges, disks, programs or games you played only contained text instructions on how the chip should play its sounds. Like sheet music or those old ragtime piano player rolls.
It's like a Tracker for olden times.
There are hundreds of chips and manufacturers made for a countless number of forgotten devices, systems, consoles and formats, and they all sound different from one another which would technically make each one a genre.
Fortunately Chiptune only focuses on a celebrated few, primarily the ones found in the most popular gaming consoles like the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and coin-op arcade games. So those are the ones I will cover. Chiptune doesn't need a genre for every type of chip. But it ought to.
Every chip is different with its own quirky limitations and I won't go into all of them. But I will describe two as an example of how restrictive it is to actually make authentic Chiptune. I'll start with the grand daddy of them all: The Nintendo Entertainment System.
First, an aside because I don't think people today really understand how all-pervasive Nintendo was back in the 80s. It wasn't just a video game system, it was a lifestyle and a culture. We didn't just play Nintendo, we ate Nintendo cereal and slept in Nintendo jammies and watched Captain N: The Game Master on Saturday mornings.
At school all we talked about at recess was Nintendo because the games were hard and there was no Internet back then so we relied on our friends (and Nintendo Power Magazine) for tips, tricks, secrets, glitches, and maps.
On the odd occasion when we beat a game, we quickly turned on our VCR and plugged in our "Nintendo Endings" VHS cassette and pushed record because we'd never know if we'd ever get the chance to beat the game again. And we needed to prove it to our friends.
Nintendo was the best way to make friends in the 80s. Because there is no greater bond than kicking Abobo off a conveyer belt.... together.
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'll never be as rad as this kid:
White sneakers, acid washed jeans, pastel-colored Ts, and a righteous flow were popular once, they will be popular again!Also: How much do you want to bet his name is Corey?
Some of the most famous melodies in the world came from Nintendo games. There are Youtube videos of people playing the Super Mario Bros theme in every conceivable way, from popping their thumbs out of their mouths to bending plastic rulers over the edge of a desk. In terms of sheer man hours exposed to human ears Koji Kondo is probably the most listened to composer in the history of the world.
Now for the dork stuff: The NES actually used a Ricoh RP2A03 microprocessor as both its CPU and its sound chip to save room (and probably cost). PAL and Famicom versions probably used something that sounded slightly different (too lazy to care -- this is an NTSC-centric scene), but all authentic NES Chiptunes adhere to the same 5-channel limitations: Two pulse wave channels, one triangle wave channel, a white noise channel, and a Delta Pulse Code Modulation or DPCM or just PCM channel. In picture form:
This part is the most important thing about Chiptune so please pay attention.
The first two channels are identical pulse wave channels used for melodies, harmonies, and rudimentary chords, and they each contain four separate pulses (at pulse-widths 12.5%, 25%, 50% ie: true square wave, and 75%, although 75% wasn't used because it sounds identical to 25%... so it's really three separate pulses) for extra timbre.
The third channel is a triangle wave used for basslines and low notes and it has no voices or volume control.
The fourth channel is white noise useful for percussion and rhythm, with two modes and 16 preset pitch settings.
And the fifth channel is a seldom used PCM channel that executes a small, razor-thin 7-bit digital sample carried by the cart, which is normally a drum kick or some other sharp sound but it can be anything, even human speech.
Some purists even consider the PCM channel cheating so really what you have are four monophonic channels: Two pulse wave, one triangle, and white noise. For a visualization of what this looks like in action, here are the four channels belching out the Super Mario Bros theme:


Bet you didn't know the drum track was just white noise. Sounds like someone shaking maracas.
	

If you want to make genuine NES music, this is what you got to work with. If you do anything that goes beyond these basic tools -- alter the oscillation, post-production compression and mixing/mastering, add reverb or chorus or even extra channels, harmonize with extra voices, apply alternate settings, add full samples like drum breaks or non-chiptune instruments, apply gates or filters or envelopes that aren't part of the original design spec, or even tool-assisted additions to increase tempo, timbre, resonance, or overdrive/overclock in a manner that the original chip cannot handle -- it's not real Chiptune. You can't even make real chords with these chips.
That doesn't mean you're not allowed to break the mold and use PSG chips in any way you want, just that you know there is a whole genre for people like you -- Fakebit. It's separated from Chiptune for a reason that I, for one, don't actually care. But it matters. It matters a lot. Don't ask why. This is the domain of the mouth-frothing aspies so all sorts of things are super important for semi-obscure reasons that only they care about.
Now let's take a look at another famous sound chip, the 6581 SID chip for the Commodore 64:
Three channels? Whoa there, slow down Mr. Grand Orchestra.
It only has three identical channels compared to five for the NES which you might think is even more limiting but each channel can play four different waveforms: Squarewave, triangle, sawtooth, and noise. Moreover, they can switch waveforms at any time giving the illusion that there are far more channels than there actually are (or by making a single channel flutter between three tones really fast to create arpeggiation). But there are only ever three sounds playing at once. Any attempt to play more sounds than that is cheating.
It is for this reason -- the raw creativity within such constraints -- that the Commodore 64 chip has attracted the most ambitious Chiptune composers (even more than Nintendo).
In spirit, Chiptune is an adherent of the 19th century French art movement known as Parnassianism which had such strict standards and rules that it made raw creativity practically impossible. The challenge was to force artists to be creative within such a narrow framework of options. Because anyone can think outside the box. That's a piece of cake. But let's see how creative you can get while remaining inside the box with the same tools and obeying the same rules as everyone else.
While Chiptune is primarily video game music and this guide is heavy on video game samples especially during the peak period of the systems in question, Chiptune is not entirely defined by video games.
Within Chiptune circles there are important divisions between the VGM scene, which is the game-based music, and composers of original music who want to be recogized as super serious independent musicians and not neo maxi zoom dweebies playing Mario on stage. I don't have those divisions here because that just sounds pedantic and stupid. Separating music for games from music not for games? Who comes up with that?
Thanks to technology more Chiptune music is being made today than even during the original product run of the game systems they're based on. And like all things blowing up, the Chiptune scene regards it as a blessing and a curse because with popularity comes exploitation and low quality, and also because this is the realm of the uber colossal super geeks. And they are nitpicky about everything.
Ish.



## FM
*aka:  Frequency Modulation, 16-bit, Yamaha, Genesis, FM Towns, Adlib, Soundblaster, Casio* in the Chiptune scene, emerged in mid 80s

FM stands for Frequency Modulation, a sound synthesis format invented by John Chowning in 1967 that dallied about in obscurity for a decade or so before Yamaha patented it for their new digital synthesizer shenanigans.
(Chowing did make some tracks with it but they're in the Experimental genre because they're more like proof-of-concept demonstrations than actual music).
FM synthesis contrasts with other forms of sound synthesis like additive, subtractive, wavetable, sample-based, linear-arithmetic, or any kind of mix-and-match hybrid that flooded the market in the early 80s. I won't go into the differences between them (that's a discussion for someplace else), suffice to say that FM synthesis made a sound that was really sharp, raspy and metallic -- perfect for abrasive timbres, percussion, brassy trumpets (I mean, compared to what went on before but by no means sounding like real trumpets), farting basslines and other sounds with complex tones that the analog synths struggled with mightily.
FM synthesis really took off with the release of the Yamaha DX7 in 1983. This synthesizer became so popular that that its distinctively bright digital sound literally defined the decade of 80s electronic music in all it's neon wireframe pastel-colored futureness (especially since FM synths did not survive past the 90s, making FM a ubiquitously 80s thing, like homoerotic action movies or kids riding their bikes and going on adventures).
Even today, when you listen to Synthwave or recall with fondness watching Transformers: The Movie on opening day on August 8 1986, the music you're mostly listening to is the DX7.
What a DX7 might look like.
What does this have to do with Chiptune? Well, the DX7 used a pair of Yamaha FM chips for its sound (warning: lots of geek talk ahead. Skip this section if you don't care): A YM21280 as an operator chip and a YM21290 as an envelope generator.
It's because of the DX7's popularity that the YM2xx series of chips became a hot commodity, and a year later Yamaha concatenated them into the YM2151 which Atari used in their new arcade game, a unique and frustrating (due to its shitty trackball controller) puzzle romper called Marble Madness -- the first FM Chiptune. Capcom, Konami and Namco soon followed and this chip and its derivatives (including the YM2203 for NEC and YM2610 for SNK) came to dominate the late 80s coin-op arcade scene.
Then Sega came along and scooped up the YM2612 chip (make sure you're writing these chip names down -- there will be a test on this later) for use in its new 16-bit Mega Drive video game console, better known as the Genesis.
What a Nintendo killer might look like.
This launched the 16-bit revolution, all of it dominated by Yamaha's FM chips. And that's why this genre got the name of this genre so you can stop wondering. If this is too much technical gobbledygook, don't worry about it. The only thing you should take from all this is that Yamaha = FM.
Because it used a soundchip from the same family the coin-ops were using, the Genesis could faithfully port arcade games with the same music and sound effects (though unfortunately some concessions were made in the graphics department. I don't care if you add bonus levels, that's not Golden Axe). Not like anyone could properly hear the game music in an arcade anyway.
Additionally, if you picked up any decent Yamaha synthesizer you could reproduce video game music without much trouble since they all used the same family of FM chips (there are Youtube videos of people modding their Genesis by swapping FM chips, with mixed results).
The Genesis is easily the most important system in the FM genre (with the possible exception of the PC but I'll get to that later), so let me go over some specs about what Genesis did that Nintendidn't.
The Genesis actually had two sound chips: The YM2612 with six monophonic FM channels (compared with just five for the NES) and being FM they could generate any waveform, not just square or triangle.
But there was also a secondary chip, a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG holdover from their 8-bit Sega Master System, for backwards compatibility. Like most PSGs this chip only had three simple square wave tone generators and one noise, and it was used for sound effects and other queued audio since it doubled as a video display controller, but composers for the Genesis found a better use for it as additional rhythm tracks and percussion (perfect for busy snare fills and New Jack Swing inspired Michael Jackson Sonic the Hedgehog).
When both chips were used to their full capacity they could punch you in the motherfucking face with ten channels of sound, and the brashness of FM made the sound aggressive, raw, and powerful like real American hero music. Looks something like this:

From Thunder Force IV - Stage 1 Boss.Why yes, ID Software's Robert Prince ripped this off for Doom E1M1. That, and Metallica.
	

There is one more FM chip to discuss: The YM3812 used by Adlib and Soundblaster soundcards for PCs. While there were other soundcards out there, it was Soundblaster that dominated the market and for a good 10 years PC game music was FM music. But it didn't have to be. Different soundcards produced different listening experiences which meant that there technically wasn't any definitive version of PC game music. The Soundblaster version was just the most popular.
As an example, here is the intro theme to the 1990 Lucasfilm adventure game The Secret of Monkey Island on various soundcards in order of quality, starting with the lowly PC Speaker and moving through the Tandy 1000, Atari ST, the CMS, Adlib/Soundblaster, Amiga, and Roland MT-32. Those annoying twerps in PC Speaker are supposed to be a marimba. And the lead is a panflute.

Compared with other cards at the time, the FM-driven Soundblaster wasn't that bad. But it still couldn't compete with the Amiga which used real samples and of course the Roland MT-32 which was technically a rack module that doubled as a soundcard and it used samples too so it's not even Chiptune let alone FM.
	

When the Internet reached the great unwashed masses, the first music files to be widely shared were small MIDI files because of their tiny size. But they didn't contain any audio, only text instructions for your soundcard. So depending on what soundcard you had, that's what you heard when you played a .mid file (usually something horrible if you were expecting an orchestra and got a tinny Casio sound).
There was a short-lived period (from about 90-94) where PCs were powerful enough to play full music but not powerful enough to play decent full music. That was when people came to associate FM with cheap, tinny Casio keyboard crap because they didn't actually know what a MIDI file was or does. You can probably stop doing that now.
If you're wondering where the Super Nintendo music is, despite being the main 16-bit foe of the Genesis during the console wars of the early 90s it was not FM or even technically Chiptune as it did no sound synthesis. It had a proprietary co-processor that used digital samples to create rich, orchestral textures much like mod trackers so it more appropriately belongs in Amiga/Tracker aka the Chiptune genre that is not a Chiptune genre.
The Super Nintendo's use of samples over synthesis was a prediction of things to come, and by 1995 memory storage and audio technology had advanced to the point where video games could carry their own CD quality audio and no longer had to rely on soundchips to produce their music.
That doesn't mean the era of Chiptunes is over, just that the technology stops at 1995 and everyone involved in the scene today celebrates that brief 15-year window when sound chips ruled video games and electronic music.

# Ambient

## Drone
*aka:  Background Noise* in the Ambient scene, emerged in early 80s

Music from airport ventilation ducts or airplane motors or the amplified hiss of radio transmissions received at the control tower, perhaps even the overlapping hum of taxis, buses, and hotel commuter engines idling at Arrivals because everything about airports is music, especially Ambient music; there should really be an entire Scene dedicated to Airport Music with dozens of genres and sub-genres and micro-genres then scene purists can fracture off into fiefdoms over what constitutes the most pure Airport music: Commercial or Freight, and they can create think-pieces on how Airport is the only true global music dedicating whole podcasts to discussing fringe segments of Airport like Seaplane and famous DJs can rinse out the music posing in front of aircrafts -- no wait, they already do that but speaking of which: Nothing captures the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune quite like the chaotic mess of human melodrama that is the Airport Departures/Arrivals -- it is humanity in its purest, most concentrated, most undistilled essence. Every evocative emotion is carried through the terminal like luggage, sometimes picking people up, sometimes dragging them down, but always present. Departures/Arrivals is where you will find immigrants welcoming their new home, over-eager tourists excited to be on a plane for the first time, a lost soul on the verge of tears wandering helplessly looking for their contact, a dour looking business class executive who can't decide whether he wants to board the next plane or put a gun in his mouth and pull the trigger, lovers embracing after being apart for too long, lovers reluctantly separating, families reuniting, students vacationing, friends crying, arguing, forgiving, or all three. There is nowhere else on Earth that displays the human condition in such a public and vociferous manner quite like the Airport -- everything that makes us human, that makes life worth living, is there (Even Cinnabon) so anyway as a musical concept Drone has existed since forever and the earliest forms of meditative humming are a type of drone sustaining and prolonging very few tones into a trance-inducing state but as music and cultures evolved over time, new instruments and techniques explored different approaches to droning from harmonizing strings to electrical feedback to Ben Stein speeches and naturally when synthesizers came about abstractionists sought ways of finding the Drone in those tones too so by their very natures Ambient and Dark Ambient are often rather droning to begin with their lengthy explorations of simple melodies or dense layers of timbre but what separates Drone into its own identity are the distinct tones, or in Drone's case the absence of it whereas Ambient often soothes and relaxes and Dark Ambient constricts and challenges yet Drone remains neutral going as atonal as it can with no hint of melody in ear-sight which means producers will stretch their drones out as long as possible well beyond the practical filling whole LPs with either minimalistic or coalescing sounds that barely constitute as music in any traditional sense and the digital age has brought these concepts to even greater absurdities with uploads and streams running hours or even days of long-lasting, singular non-music sounds. Surely something so blatantly abstract could never attract a commercial following but never underestimate the outsider's need to latch onto something that popular people won't because something so determinedly niche is pure catnip for those who fancy themselves cultivators of "true culture", at least one obligatory Drone album cropping up in yearly Best Of lists by the usual wanking music journalism suspects. Drone found a healthy following from Death Metal sorts exploring the extreme end of their grinding bass feedback though as this isn't Ishkur's Guide To Metal Music, such stuff isn't touched upon here but okay one namedrop: Sunn O))). As for Electronic Music many of the regular Ambient and Dark Ambient guys will indulge in a pure Drone track or four breaking up their usual monotony with something even more monotonous but folks down in the Experimental side of things often take on the odd Drone track too though as an extreme artistic challenge compared to the Ambient scene's more traditional take on the genre.

The greatest Drone track of all time: The USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D engine humm. This is the 1 hour radio mix. There are 12 hour and 24 hour club mixes on Youtube.

## Dark Ambient
*aka:  Atmospheric Industrial* in the Ambient scene, emerged in early 80s

Music for cowering in the corners of old, abandoned, rotting airports, with hellspawn creatures creeping in the shadows. At night. With no moon. Or stars. In the Silent Hill dimension.
As a scene, Ambient has cultivated several stylistic sub-genres since its original arty inception. None are more prominent than Dark Ambient, a genre that has cultivated numerous stylistic variations of itself, many in stark contrast to the Ambient one.
It makes sense, what with the typical dualist perspectives of most things: The Yin and the Yang; the political Left and the political Right; the positive charge and the negative charge; the Upside to the Schwartz and the Downside to the Schwartz; the peanut butter and the jelly.
So where Ambient welcomes the dawn Dark Ambient welcomes the night (it's Batman). If some Ambient sounds angelic and dreamy, Dark Ambient sounds demonic and nightmarish. Ambient calms and soothes, Dark Ambient intensifies and irritates. Ambient can be spacious, filled with the natural sounds of sunny meadows and blissful forests. Dark Ambient will go bleak as a winter tundra and as claustrophobic as old-growth jungle. Space Ambient explores the wonders and grandeur of the Cosmos, but Dark Space Ambient crushes your sense of being with endless emptiness and isolation.
Most of this is a recent development in Dark Ambient circles. Much of the genre's early years are more of an experimental offshoot of Industrial music. As that scene led to morbid influences that included Goth, themes of the occult found their ways into the bleak soundscapes. Much like how mainform Ambient and New Age had producers shifting between the two in the 80s, Dark Ambient and Ethereal music had its share of shared musicians.
And like its popular older father, Dark Ambient had an uptick of interest in the 90, with its own assorted micro-labels and Very Important People who released tons of material only obsessive completists would be interested in. But throughout it all Dark Ambient could never shake its reputation as the creepy weird kid of the Ambient world and it likely would have remained a super-niche genre for fans of the bleak and macabre.
But something changed this past decade. Dark Ambient has exploded with releases that dwarf its earlier output. Part of that is due to the same "ease of access" factor that flooded Ambient with Laptop productions, but there's more going on to this story than that.
A healthy, vibrant scene has emerged of musicians and consumers actively exploring twisted takes on our regular lives, reflecting our past sins and contemplating our future damnations.
Dark Ambient dares venturing into themes most electronic music would rather ignore in favor of the optimistic, the instantaneous and the Now. End of days, end of civilizations, feelings of intense isolationism in spite of a socially flattening society. Contemplating whether we've grown so jaded as a people, so reckless as a species, and so blinded by our hubris that we willfully ignore the rot that surrounds us and whether we should embrace the nothingness that marks our destiny.
But enough about US politics.
Dark Ambient doesn't claim to have answers, but it does love asking the questions.
Strangely, for a scene that can come off pretentiously grim-dark from the outside Dark Ambient is one of the more friendly groups you'll encounter in electronic music. Comfort in shared depression, perhaps. Nothing helps a bad mood like spreading it around.
Syk.


## Ambient
*aka:  Ambient, Laptop Ambient* in the Ambient scene, emerged in mid 70s

Music for tranquil Japanese gardens and trickling waterfalls in a snowy meadow while taking a nap at the airport.
While synths were making big strides in disco clubs and pop radio stations, the arty snobs of the music world had their own thing going with modular keyboards and studio tape loops to create- nay, paint canvases with abstract tones and timbre.
The idea, prominently explored by admitted non-musician Brian Eno, was to make music that one didn't even have to pay attention to, following up on the sort of non-art notions French artists were all about in the early 20th Century. Eno was traveling similar paths of contemporary abstract composers like John Cage but taking things to the new 70s hotness realm of studio electronics.
Eno had made a few records doing this but nothing crystallized his ideas into their purest, perfect, flawless form as Music For Airports. It just so happened that he tagged it with a catchy concept header called "Ambient", which was such an addictive marketing term that music magazines retroactively and forever thereafter tagged anything that sounded like this music as Ambient.
What ambient might look like.
The weird, other-worldly sounds in Krautrock songs? Oh, that was Ambient! Terry Riley's minimalist excursions? Totally Ambient! The psychedelic space rock of Pink Floyd? Okay, that was Prog Rock, but it could also be Ambient! And then there were the various soundtrack scores using synths as sonic padding.
Ambient may have started out as art music but folks quickly realized it had a remarkable soothing effect, luring in mystic musicians looking for new ways to find peace and meditation in a trying age (there was a gas shortage and high inflation, you see. And all the movies had downer endings).
This set off the Great Ambient Wars of the 80s where producers would flirt between making Art Ambient and New Age Ambient. Not that anyone cared since most of the music was so unassuming, relaxing, and occasionally stuffy. It seldom broke out of niche scenes populated by pretentious sorts.

Ambient's early days, before it gentrified.
	

The scene didn't gain much interest beyond the insular art and New Age scenes, until raves happened.
Burned out ravers dancing all weekend found Ambient a much comforting respite. A kindly Doctor of the Patterson started spinning these old Ambient records in rave chill rooms. The KLF told everyone to Chill Out and The Orb sent people Adventuring Beyond the Ultraworld.
Ambient was cool enough that retrospective compilations of seminal 70s stuff flooded the market, often paired with new tunes of the 90s which came with a House or Techno beat. Like Heavy Metal ballads or the R&B cut on Rap records, every producer put an Ambient or Chill Out tune on their albums, showing off their musical curiosity like they're the fucking Beatles. As if they had to honor the Pioneers who had never stepped into a club or rave but had no problem wasting your time with hours-long noodly synth sessions.

Somehow scientists have objectively verified this as "the world's most relaxing song". And by scientists I mean people who have listened to zero Ambient music whatsoever.(Marconi Union - Weightless


Despite the uptick of interest as comedown music for mentally gassed ravers, Ambient never saw much commercial success, with most releases coming out on ultra-obscure labels with limited run tapes, CDs, CDrs, mini-CDs, CD3s, C-Beams, and some vinyl too.
There are tons of Ambient albums out there. Ambient composers average around a half dozen releases per year, jumping to their next four-chord five-hour drone symphony just as soon as their previous five-tone, three-hour pad composition leaves the studio.
Then the Internet bust the door wide open with easier access to softsynths and self-release options and the Ambient scene was quickly flooded with Laptop Ambient where any schlub with a hankering for noodly wank could write, record, and release multiple albums in a single day.
Or sometimes all that was needed was a single technique such as the Justin Bieber track that was slowed down 800% and given heavy reverb into an Ambient viral sensation so popular the technique was ripped off for the Slo-mo scenes in the 2012 movie Dredd.

Cersei Lannister has really let herself go.
	

Once the refuge for only the most artistically inclined of electronic music followers, Ambient has literally no barrier to entry, which means surfing through the scene is one of the most challenging prospects in all music let alone electronic music. Like trying to read every Reddit thread, it is impossible to consume even a third of Ambient's annual output. There are only so many hours in the day, so don't bother trying. Just find a dozen producers, labels, or radio streams that catch your ear, and that should suffice for all your Ambient needs.
Syk.

# Chill Out

## New Age
*aka:  Meditation music, yoga pilates tai chi indigo crystal spiritual wellness faith healing sounds* in the Chill Out scene, emerged in mid 70s

What can be said about New Age that doesn't devolve into sniggering, cynical snark? Let's start with the origins as they're humble enough.
Back in the 60s when everyone was heading west in search of musical freedom, spiritual enlightenment, and really good acid, a New York City jazzist by the name of Steven Halpern joined the exodus. While chillin' and relaxin' with the hippies discovering Eastern mysticism through drugs, he started making simple, calming minimalistic music with electric pianos -- static, harmonic tones meant to heal chakras or increase your chi or some such nonsense.
Steven Halpern working his new musical instrument: Purple glowy thingy.
In what had to be a total coincidence, Terry Riley was doing similar stuff around the same time in Europe but as Art rather than a dubious concept like faith healing. Riley thus got all the record deals, critical praise, and inspirational namedrops from Ambient and Krautrock musicians of the 70s while Halpern remained in obscurity.
Not that Halpern cared because he had his audience and he kept doing his own thing with little recognition. When he finally did get around to releasing a debut album - Spectrum Suite in 1975 - it was a self-released effort, something he'd continue to do for a decade before being picked up by a major distributor.
Though New Age music as a genre wouldn't take off until the 80s, Halpern's methods laid the groundwork for its early and most definitive attributes: Music intended for spiritual relaxation, religious healing and dorky self help videos. It was an ironically punk enterprise for a form of music that was completely antithetical to punk.
Something strange happened in the 80s though, and by strange I mean incredibly predictable to anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology and demographics. All the free love and LSD dropping Boomers in the 60s were adults now, and adulting is hard what with the paying of the bills and the raising of the children and such as.
The Era Of Reagan was all about crass consumism, keeping up with the Joneses, and living a life of applied docility as portrayed in the excellent documentary They Live:
A Testament for our times.
It left many of these ex-hippies feeling tired, depleted, and spent, unsure where they could turn to for some meaning to the conspicuous consumption and empty yuppie lifestyle. The church? Hell no, their parents did that. Surely there was something newer and of a hip age that could serve the same need, something with ties to their youth. You bet there was!
What had once been relegated to the outskirts of society and populated mostly by spiritual kooks was soon flooded with suburbanites searching for some relief from their hectic lives. It sold itself as having all the answers the ancient mystics curated for thousands of years but wrapped up in familiar Western accruements.
And New Age (as well as Oprah) provided it all: The self-help books, the alt-medical treatments, the nifty jewelry that could unlock chakras (somehow), and most importantly the music to send them into a soothing, relaxing meditative bliss.
New Age hit the mainstream, selling itself as the wave of the future for enlightened sorts who just so happened to be a little flush with cash. It also hit mainstream mockery, derided as quick-fix bollocks in the face of real issues of the day.
Perception of New Age reached a stalemate between the two, receding to background noise in the culture wars ever since, and mostly forgotten these days. A newer age is blossoming into adulthood, after all.

And this was on TV all the fucking time.
	

Now, the music. As New Age sprung up around the same time as Ambient, the two often intermingled on compilations and meditation tapes and the like but the two scenes generally had very little to do with each other.
Ambient purists would froth at the mouth at having their high-brow abstract art music associated with that chintzy New Age schmaltz while New Age purists enjoyed both and didn't see what the problem was. Both worked serving as backing soundtracks to yoga gatherings, meditation retreats, health spas, all that rot. Clearly one side in this "war" has its cranium firmly wedged up its rectum and it's not the flakey crystal worshippers.
If you're having trouble differentiating between Ambient and New Age, the key difference is Ambient continuously strives for sonic wallpaper abstraction whereas New Age almost never does.
Ambient will noodle about in the background with little apparent direction, but New Age holds you by your hand (heart/chakra/spirit/soul/spleen/supercilium), guiding you to whatever healing, cleansing, or realignment you need from it.
If Ambient aims to remove the presence of the musician making it, then New Age makes damned sure you know there's a real human playing that panflute or harp solo. Ambient will treat vocalists as but another layer of timbre, but you won't mistake Constance Demby or Enya when their voices are reverbed into an indecipherable wall of sound.
New Age has tons of sub-genres. Half of them are muzaky Western interpretations of traditional Folk songs from around the globe, including the Western ones (Celtic, Balearic, Native American, Icelandic throat-singing). Others are functionalist, intended as music in service of particular New Age activities: Meditation, chakra realignment, reiki therapy, yoga, hot yoga, naked yoga, yoga on a beach, yoga on a nude beach, yoga at sunrise, yoga on a mountain, yoga under the sea (that bass!), yoga in space, and yoga of mass destruction.
Only the second most popular form of yoga next to low fat Greek yoga.
Even if New Age culture has waned and morphed into something else compared to its 80s heyday, interest in the music continues. Soundtracks for mystic shenanigans will always find an audience and plenty of pan pipe musicians with synth pads and bird samples will eagerly provide it.
Syk.


## Worldbeat
*aka:  Ethnic Beat, Ethnic Fusion, Tribal Chill, World Music* in the Chill Out scene, emerged in early 80s

Worldbeat is New Age with more ethnic influences than its aging audience of Boomer hippies and anti-vaccine mommy bloggers feel comfortable enjoying. Or it's New Age with a more consistent uptempo beat. But it's a tribal beat.
As our global space continues to shrink, more and more cultures come into contact with each other, exposing their music in the process. Though much of it initially seems tonally incompatible (no one's exactly rushing to use the Indonesian Slendro scale or Arabic maqam in western music), enterprising artists have found ways of blending disparate melodies and harmonies together, fusing far flung Asian folk with peppy Western pop, or rhythm-heavy tribal beats melding with swinging jazz drums.
Once studio wizardry could sample sounds from across the world, this opened a new avenue of musical fusion -- Mongolian throat singers and pygmy chanters rubbing shoulders with Celtic harpists and 303 knob twiddlers.
Worldbeat is thus a celebration of humanity as a whole, ignoring the racial barriers we've inflicted upon ourselves, uniting under common musical ground in hopes of becoming one global nation fostering peace, love, unity, and respect.
What sick, perverted ambition would drive a man to seek warm relations with his neighbors?
Or...
Worldbeat is cultural appropriation and is therefore offensive, like white guys playing lacrosse or Lady Gaga dressing like Roison Murphy. It is a form of neo-colonialism: Pretentious rich musicians in Western countries go exploring overseas, discovering new land in "ethnic" music, planting a flag of creativity and calling it an original fusion style, making bank on the sales charts and never sending a single penny back to the original musicians. Okay sometimes they did but not always.
Fortunately the cultural appropriation goes both ways, with native artists using synths and drum machines to accentuate their own rich artistic heritage.
Whatever side you want to take in this argument is up to you, but it all defines what kind of stick you have up your bum.
In terms of electronic music, the earliest examples of Worldbeat came from two sources: The first is World music, an acoustic variant of Folk that bridged different cultures (think Zamfir - The Lonely Shepherd).
The other is the New Wave scene, mostly British musicians looking for new ways to deconstruct Pop Rock, like Peter Gabriel and The Police, scoring huge hits while introducing ethnic-sounding instruments. When they did this it was just called Ethnic Fusion. This was during the "We Are The World" phase of the 80s where global awareness became a hot topic for many western artists eager to become nauseatingly insufferable.
As a genre, Worldbeat didn't really exist yet, though sampling made Ethnic Fusion easier, more common, and more palateable for western audiences. Then in 1990 a guy named Michael Cretu released this:
Yes, it's the one the whispering French girl. And the Gregorian chanting. And the panflutes. And the beat lifted -- not sampled -- from Ashley's Roachclip. But not the wailing Indian -- that was on the next album.This is one of those albums that you've probably already heard every song on it despite not owning it or conscientiously going out of your way to actually listen to it. Like in the grocery store or in a TV show or car commercial. It's so pop culture canon it has become cliche.
Not only did Enigma's debut effort smash the charts by blending erotic club beats, ethnic instruments, and Western vocals (Gregorian chants might as well be Western), but it also crossed over many scenes in the process. Clubbers took note. New Agers took note. Softcore porn Erotic film producers definitely took notice. And boy did the labels take note.
Copycats flooded the market looking to capitalize on Enigma's success. And with so many ethnic cultures to exploit for samples, there would be an unlimited source of gravy for this train. Except it all kind of petered out by the mid 90s, with most consumers treating Worldbeat as a charming fad that scored a couple memorable tunes but nothing they wanted to explore further.
While all that was happening an underground variant of Worldbeat found success with crusty outdoor rave parties. Less cynically motivated by the mighty corporate doller, these producers sought to retain the cultural heritage within their samples, crafting dance beats in service of the woodwinds and sitars and yodeling.
Ask any of these producers if they make Worldbeat though and they'll deny it, the name more defiled than a Kardashian at an NAACP convention. Just as well that much of this strain of Worldbeat eventually merged with Psydub which carries on to this day, or freeform prog jazz-rock folk which will never exist on this Guide.
But wait, there's a third variant of Worldbeat, the authentic stuff! It probably existed in some form as far back as electronic instruments were made available. But just as the commercial side of Worldbeat suffocated on its own success, bands, groups, and producers from across the globe were making their own beats, even sometimes with Western market penetration in mind.
Quite a few labels sprung up to support these acts in such exotic lands like Malibu (Triloka Records) and San Francisco (Six Degree Records).
One can divide all this into its various regional and cultural sub-genres but that would balloon this Guide to ludicrious levels of splintering. You can tell which is which by the samples anyway.
Syk.


## Chill Out
*aka:  Ambient House, Balearic* in the Chill Out scene, emerged in late 70s

Chill Out as a genre doesn't exist in the strictest sense. It's more of a mish-mash of music that doesn't tidily fit elsewhere, but still bound together by that unmistakable chill vibe that goes down easy like a fresh glass of cool lemonade or lightly sprinkled vanilla sundae. And everyone likes vanilla, especially white people.
Basically, it is the music that goes best with this picture:
Brownsville turnaround on the Tex-Mex border, pulling out of Ricardo and the dusk is falling fast. Six hours to Louisiana, black coffee going cold. Dream time in lake Jackson -- Madrugada Eterna. Justified and Ancient seems a long time ago with Elvis on the radio and steel guitar in my soul. It's 3 AM somewhere out of Beaumont -- Wichita Lineman was a song I once heard. Trancentral lost in my mind; the lights of Baton Rouge pass by while a melody from a past life keeps pulling me back. Rock radio into the nineties and beyond, and I'm alone again with the dawn coming up.
Thus, we can say that Chill Out is one of the most commercially successful genres around, an easily marketed sound that can pluck whatever traits from whatever contemporary scenes it so chooses as long as it adheres to keeping the tone light and breezy.
And while artist singles and albums can do reasonably well, Chill Out's main commercial avenue is the compilation: Labels rounding up various tunes into eye-catching CDs with some loose concept tying them all together.
A Balearic theme is quite common with many producers capturing the mood of relaxing on Ibizan beaches and lounging at the Cafe Del Mar. Or perhaps a mystical tone is explored as is done in the Psy Chill camps. Some might go for a headier concept, where genre fusion and exploration is encouraged though not so much as to scare away potential buyers. Others aim for as much money as they can possibly make, cramming in as many familiar chart-topping artists they can so you'll at least recognize a few for your impulse buy.
The turn of the century in particular saw an excessive bloat in the Chill Out compilation industry, when artists like Moby, AIR, and Royksopp had radio hits aplenty.
No surprise that major label execs figured that this was their new cash cow in Electronic Music. Not only did it appeal to post-comedown party kids but their moms too, as heard in movie soundtracks, advertisement jingles, or played over the radio while shopping at the market.
If anything, the music in Chill Out is defined by what it lacks compared to the genres it's cribbing from. It is Ambient Techno without the Techno; it is Downtempo without the Funk; it is Trip Hop without the Trip and little of the Hop; it is Psydub without the Dub and little of the Psy; it is Worldbeat without the world; it is New Age without the sap; it is Shoegaze Pop without the Indie; it is Synthpop without the Pop.
It is the Timbits without the donut.
There are a million-and-one micro-genres scattered throughout Chill Out, some of which could have spun off into their own little branches if more producers had caught onto them and followed suit. Often these tracks were dalliances by their creators, one-offs that tried something different and didn't really need a follow-up anyway. Or they were so unique from the norm that no one dared to style-bite, lest they come off as hacks in the process.
Thus you get things like Ambient House in here, which consisted of The Orb - Little Fluffy Clouds and nothing else of note. And tracks like Manuel Gottsching - E2-E4, an almost unclassifiable electro-jazz-fusion-chill session. Plus producers like Solar Fields, who plied his trade with Psydub and Progpsy but didn't completely mesh with them either. Not to mention chaps like Ulrich Schnauss who does a shoegaze Trip Hop thing that's so distinctly him that no one dares ride his "schnauss".
Syk.


## Indie
*aka:  Indie Pop, Shoegaze, Dreampop, Chillwave* in the Chill Out scene, emerged in early 90s

Indie is not an electronic music genre, proper. It is the most non-electronic genre on this guide (with the possible exception of Industrial Rock), but it does have significant electronic instrumentation which is why it's here. But just the electronic stuff. So Shoegaze is represented but Emo is not. Dreampop is here but Goth Pop is not.
Indie is short for Independent as it invokes images of scraggly-bearded garage bands wearing skinny jeans and busking for coins in dive bars and low class cafes while singing about messy breakups. But some Indie is not like that. Some Indie relies heavily on sequencers, effects pedals, touch pads, and synthesizers to accentuate their output, and while the main focus is still guitar-based rock, they wouldn't sound like anything without their electronic gizmos.
Interestingly when Indie musicians choose to dabble with electronic instruments they tend to look for things to accentuate their existing sound rather than something that will replace it, so they eschew the beat-driven nonsense that powers most of the other genres. Instead they texturize their palette with sweeping soundscapes and overtures, making their music more chill and hazy which is why it functions as a Chill Out genre more than anything else.
Indie's DIY spirit, lo-fi aesthetics and anti-commercial sentiment (sort of) gives it a quality similar to Punk, and although Indie probably came from Punk, it is decidedly not and I'll explain why. It all has to do with Indie's prime demographic: Hipsters.
A hipster bingo card circa 2001, an indication that hipsters have been a problem for quite awhile.
Above all, hipsters desire authenticity. They think they can get it by miming whatever has been deemed authentic, but they are tragically unable to grasp the internal contradiction that miming authenticity is itself an inherently inauthentic act.
When the authentic thing that hipsters are inauthentically miming gets popular and other people start doing it, hipsters always react negatively because they see the inauthenticity in other people joining a fad or trend but are unable to see it in themselves. This is why they always respond with scorn and derision when it comes to knowing/liking/listening to music before others have. Or better yet music that no one else has heard (thus preserving their faux-inauthenticity).
To be a hipster is to be in a state of constantly searching for an authentic source of something that is not currently being expressed inauthentically by anyone else (hence the mashing of retro styles like growing a Victorian mustache, wearing a trucker hat, and riding a fixie bike with one pant leg rolled up while listening to vinyl music on an old hand-cranked phonograph and drinking home brewed kambucha mixed with artisanal donkey milk).
If this is not possible then they will indulge it on a superficial level (you know, for the irony) to maintain the insecure notion of their own authenticity. And so long as they enjoy it on a different level than anyone else, they consider themselves in the clear.
True originality and inspiration must be your own individual indomitable self. You can be influenced by other styles and ideas but what you come up with must germinate from your own imagination. And it must be honest and true to yourself. That is the nature of authenticity.
Hipsters are creative, but they do not create. In fact, they cannot create because in that moment of creation they cease to be hipsters. Creating things is a demonstration that the creator understands that true authenticity comes from within. You cannot understand this and be a hipster.
You cannot mime other styles and call it your own style of "miming other styles". It'd be like a painter cutting out parts of other paintings and putting them on his canvas and calling it an original painting. Yes, the collage is a valued form of art, but it is not an original painting if you did not paint it.
That is what hipsters are doing. They are mistaking the aesthetics of the style for the intent.
How does that differ from Punk?
Well Punk is about authenticity. You have to be authentic to be Punk. It's not about the noise, or the aggression, or the slovenly unpolished behavior. It's about being you. It's about being real. It's about being Punk.
Wesley Willis is Punk. Daniel Johnston is Punk. Punk isn't about being commercial, or about changing yourself so others will like you. It's about your individual maturity, and your absolute ability to not give a fuck what anyone else thinks.
This is why hipsters are the antithesis of Punk. They try to appeal to people's sense of nostalgia, to their past, to what they think is important when they fail to realize that the only important thing is themselves. As soon as you stop miming other scenes, only then can you be you.
It requires a certain level of vulnerability and courage to stand up for something that you genuinely believe in irrespective of its worth, value, or criticism. Having convictions is something that regular hipsters sorely lack so the applied attitude of meta-hipsters in any situation is to never be sincere. They (usually) call it trolling, but it's really just typical post-teenage insecurity.
If hipsters like Indie music because it's some throwback to the guitar bands their parents listened to while at the same time not being "mainstream", they're going about it wrong. Music appreciation occurs best in a vaccuum. Never enjoy something based on who does (or does not) like it.

Not actually Indie Pop. There's a lot of Dancepunk, House and Synthpop sprinkled about and it's not all that cohesive. But it works as a sampler of what my "Indie" discography might look like. 
	

With that said, Indie is actually quite good and I'd like it a lot more if it weren't for all the fucking hipsters.
Ish.
PS: If you're coming here from Pitchfork, go fuck yourself.

# Downtempo

## Dub
*aka:  Reggae Dub, Ambient Dub* in the Downtempo scene, emerged in late 60s

Dub music is part genre, part limitation in music production.
It got its name from the early production technique known as "overdubbing", where producers would record and re-record music tracks over top one another on reel-to-reel tape machines (ask your grandparents if you don't know what that is).
It was common for demo and rehearsal sessions to use the same reel for hundreds of takes and versions to save money. The recordings were never perfect and the residual effects of earlier recordings would leak into latter recordings producing a hazy ghosting effect that producers would come to regard as features (not bugs).
Dubbing eventually became synonymous with recording an audio track over top something else (as in ADR in movies, or dubbing in cartoons and foreign languages). But it has its origins in Reggae producers who were simply too poor and too cheap to buy another tape.
As for the official start of Dub music, there's an interesting story behind that. Well, interesting to people who care about this music.
It all started with an unfinished pressing of The Paragon - On The Beach, which left out the vocals during a dub plate printing back in 1968.
What cutting a dub plate might look like. A dub plate is a cheap, one-off acetate disc that has a limited lifespan of about 50 listens before it degrades, usually used for demos, white labels, unreleased versions, alternate masters, test runs, and initial singles releases before the final version comes out on vinyl.

According to legend a sound system operator (Rudolph "Ruddy" Redwood, trivia fans) took the mispressed single and played it at one of those legendary Jamaican toasting parties (where Rap and Dancehall came from) with some audience interaction singing along. And of course it brought the house down otherwise we would not know of this piece of folklore today.
This caught the attention of Bunny Lee, a producer for famed Jamaican label Treasure Isle. Sensing a hot trend, Bunny approached the studio's sound engineer, Osbourne Ruddock, about making more of these instrumental Reggae, Rocksteady, and Ska tracks.
Already technically proficient with studio gear, Mr. Ruddock custom made mixing boards to get maximum impact from echo, delay and phase effects, which he'd showcase in his own soundsystem shows. He seldom had much opportunity to explore their potential in the recording studio as such trickery was seen as little more than a novelty. The recording process in those days always emphasized the singers and musicians, never the producers.
With the unexpected success of that one mispressed version, however, Ruddock was suddenly given the green light to do all manner of interesting things with instrumentals. He didn't disappoint, creating an array of dubbed singles for competing Jamaican soundsystems, with many new singles demanding his special touch on the b-sides.
Eventually Ruddock's unique remixes were in such demand that he set up his own studio. There he jerry-rigged old and new gear to such a degree that his mixing console essentially become its own electronic instrument, manipulating tracks in whatever manner he saw fit with precision control. Other prominent Jamaican producers would soon learn his craft and Mr. Ruddock showed them the way, forever changing the way reggae instrumentals would be created. He would go down as one of the most influential producers in not just Jamaican music history or electronic music history, but all music history.
Osbourne Ruddock was his name but you can call him King Tubby.
King Tubby beside his mobile sound system, record label, home, and ice cream van.
Could Dub music have been invented earlier and somewhere else? Possibly, but it didn't. Those cavernous echos and delay effects prominently pulling out drums and bass 'riddims' creates something of a temporal dissonance within your consciousness, sounding as though you're riding that reverb beyond the boundaries of the dancehall and out into the far reaches of the cosmos. Also, you smoked too much.
Coincidentally, smoking the ganja has a similar effect so the two have a cozy relationship with each other. I'm not saying you have to take a toke of the mary jane to get Dub music, but like amphetamines with NRG and horse tranquilizers with Dubstep, it helps.
Since traditional music media seldom gave two shits about what Jamaica was doing back then, Dub remained stuck on the island throughout the 70s. But once British Punk and New Wave rockers started cribbing Reggae and Ska aesthetics in their music (seriously, what's up with that), suddenly an abundance of 'dub versions' started showing up in record stores. It's hard to get white people to like something unless other white people like it first.
By this point King Tubby had retreated from production but between the two island nations a whole slew of new cats followed in his footsteps: Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Sly & Robbie, Prince Jammy, Mikey Dread, Mad Professor, Jah Alchemist, Doctor Petty Bobbie, Rude Examiner, Duke Tutor, Errol The Irie Instructor, Lenny 'Dub' Lecturer, Terrance Teacher, Dubplate Assistant, Sammy Souljia Sensei, and Scientist.
By the late 80s and with the advent of sampling Dub music exploded since it no longer had to rely on clumsy reel-to-reel tape decks. Dub -- which was once a laborious process of recording and re-recording -- had been reduced to push-button simplicity at the production level. New subgenres made use of trippy, cavernous effects which worked really well in chill-out rooms full of drugged out ravers, because of course it did.
Before long many scenes would have their own special Dub subgenres, including but not limited to House, Techno, Psy Trance and eventually IDM, Drum n Bass and UK Garage (with mixed results). For the sake of consistency, mostly stuff that retains Jamaican music traditions falls under this line, with a few examples of the early 90s Ambient Dub sub-genre thrown in for good measure. If you want to hear examples of how Dub has influenced other genres, you won't have far to search.
Dub carries on to this day, some producers pushing the reverb effects to the outer limits of practicality, others keeping things simple the way King Tubby did, like homemade pot brownies (the way mom made them). In some ways Dub is the Blues of Electronic Music: Pioneered by poor black people, influencing and co-opted by white people into more successful things, yet retaining its fundamental simplicity after all these years.
You have to respect it for that.
Syk.


## Trip Hop
*aka:  Illbient* in the Downtempo scene, emerged in mid 90s

Trip Hop comes from Bristol. That's all you need to know.
More specifically, Trip Hop came about when Downtempo guys from Bristol smoked too much weed. In much the same way Grunge came about when punk metal guys from Seattle did too much heroin.
It was bound to happen, all that wonderful, spliffed-out Dub production cozying up to Funk and Soul, riding Hip Hop rhythms to the outer reaches of your consciousness-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s. Groups like Nightmares On Wax and Massive Attack were already exploring how deep those vibes could go.
It wasn't until 1994 that enough acts got in on the act such that music journalists had to take notice. And by "had" I mean eagerly lapped up any artist with a take on 'psychedelic urban soul' like a thirsty dog at a water dish.
So while you can undoubtedly point to a few stray tracks predating this year as being Trip Hop, 1994 is generally agreed upon as the year that the genre cemented its identity, from which all the copycats followed.
This was the year of Portisehead's debut, Massive Attack's sophomore, DJ Shadow's debut (well, late 93), DJ Krush's debut, 9 Lazy 9's debut, plus early rumblings from future Very Important Trip Hop Artists like Tricky, Howie B, The Herbaliser, Attica Blues, and, um, Rob Dougan. Okay fine let's include him.

But understand that no matter how many movie trailers and car commercials licensed Clubbed To Death, it's not Trip Hop.
	

Naturally, the British rags were quick in declaring this Fresh Sound Of British Urban Soul as the New Hotness, though the chap credited with first associating the name Trip Hop with the sound is Mixmag scribe Andy Pemberton. Remember that factoid for the Trivial Pursuit version of this Guide.
Labels that made Acid Jazz their go-to sound for inner city cred switched over. Thanks to some savvy signings one print did it so completely that most think of them as the ones who nurtured Trip Hop right from the start. No, not Ninja Tune though they certainly had their fingers in the pot.
Rather, it was Mo Wax, run by James Lavelle (ie: UNKLE).

90s Electronic music videos are best electronic music videos. Too bad such a riveting video had to be ruined by Thom Yorke's whiny crooning.(UNKLE - Rabbit In Your Headlights


Aside from the Big Two of Three From Bristol, Mo Wax had all the critically acclaimed hits of Trip Hop's mid 90s peak. Only appropriate that once the genre faded in prominence after the turn of the century, the label folded as well.
Yeah, of course Trip Hop wasn't going to last as a critical darling. Like all fads, over time the rougher edges that marked its early identity were smoothed over, turning Trip Hop into a shiny, polished genre perfect for ads, commercial compilations, and movie soundtracks.

And theme music for primetime television.(Massive Attack - Teardrop).
	

Almost as a counter to its growing popularity, an offshoot of Trip Hop emerged that went ever deeper down the dubbed-out psychedelic hole: Illbient. Unlike Trip Hop's use of vocals covering topics ranging from existential angst to social angst (you know, Gen-X issues), Illbient went for pure instrumentals and abstract sounds, sometimes getting downright sludgy like you're lost in a heroin bender. It had some minor success with turntablists and vinyl fiends but because it was never more than Trippier Hop it didn't last much beyond the year 2000.
Trip Hop continues to this day, sort of. Some call it 'post Trip Hop', but calling anything 'post' is stupid. It has generally moved on from its original sample-heavy attributes into something that reflects the trendy sounds du jour, like Glitch effects or Indie music. So long as it holds some semblance of Hip Hop rhythm with melodramatic Soul singing though, you're fine still calling it Trip Hop. This is one of those genres you don't really need to get super anal about.
Syk.


## Downtempo
*aka:  Ninja Tune* in the Downtempo scene, emerged in early 90s

Downtempo is the result of various urban genres (including genres from the Urban scene) looking to chill the fuck out.
For sure there were slower paced examples of Jazz, RB, Funk, Dub, and Soul for as long as those genres have existed. Downtempo brought them all together into the same lounge, handed them all a nice fat spliff and let the magic happen as DJs blended their various vibes together.
Not too much though, everyone sticking to pair-offs for a groovy dance or two before mingling with someone else, like a prim and proper ballroom waltz. Except down in some dingy basement dive where the smoke is thick and the booze is cheap. If you happened to pair up with someone from your own genre you'd just end up back in your own scene anyway.
Thus you end up with tracks where a Funk break meets a Jazz clarinet solo and little else going on. Or a Soul sista belts some wisdom over a Dub rhythm. Or a looping violin rides a Hip-Hop beat. Or a woozy horn echoes from beyond Dub's reaches while records get some scratch action on. Or a beatnik drops esoteric knowledge to a gospel sing-along fronted by a Bootsy bassline. Or organ licks shuffle about boppin' Casio beats. Or...
Clams and ice cream served in a Downtempo lounge near you.
Look, there are a lot of different combinations in Downtempo. The genre is just a mishmash of stuff that doesn't tidily fit elsewhere within the other prominent genres of this scene.
The glue holding it all together is the unmistakable groove that feels like the offspring of Funk and Dub making sweet love on a comfy sofa. You can toss whatever else you'd like into that for a little three-way action, though don't get greedy by thinking Downtempo is some orgy. One of the most successful acts within this genre, Kruder & Dorfmeister, knew that a little Pop, Hip Hop, or even Drum n Bass was all you needed. Or take Thievery Corporation, adding Latin jams to the mix, made for some proper sexy times indeed.
Naturally a genre this loose in its definitions will have a number of labels supporting the sound, but none come to dominate Downtempo so thoroughly as Ninja Tune.
What an iconic label logo looks like.
The lads behind the label, Matt Black and Jonathan More (ie: Coldcut) were already obsessive vinyl hounds and they even had some prior commercial success making UK House with the hit Doctorin' The House (which The Timelords lampooned with Doctorin' The Tardis). They used the proceeds to set up Ninja Tune, which mostly offered DJ tools with the occasional Oldskool Rave Hardcore record thrown in.
Being such eclectic record hunters, Coldcut quickly caught onto Downtempo's developments and brought Ninja Tune up to speed, adding a pile of DJs and producers to their roster. Then, in a move that gave them a heads-up over British competition, Ninja Tune found distribution deals in North America, spreading their gospel of jazzy, funky, trippy Downtempo tunes everywhere.
You couldn't go into a record shop without spotting that iconic logo (yeah, that one above), whipping vinyl at your face like a foreign stealth assassin of music. And when some within the scene faded, Ninja Tune were always among the first picking up the latest, freshest sounds coming from the London underground.
They outlasted their 90s competition and kept pace with all the upstarts of the new millennium. They'll probably still be around after the fall of civilization, somehow getting the latest tunes from decaying urban ghettos to the ears of savvy souls of Funk n Groove.
Like this guy -- the apocalypse is no reason to not get down and boogie.
A common question that crops up is what's the difference between Downtempo and Chill Out. Aren't they both forms of music for laying back and enjoying some tunes? This is true but their approaches are different.
Downtempo is the sort of music that makes sense in urban lofts, chic enclaves, and smoky speakeasies, whereas Chill Out is typically played near exotic pools, meditative gatherings, and suburban dwellings. In other words, if Downtempo is the sweaty, bump n grind, Marvin Gaye smooth croon, then Chill Out is the snuggly, missionary, serenade from Sting. You know, black and white stuff.
Still, there is one significant thing both Downtempo and Chill Out have in common: They are both very popular options for commercial advertisements.
Syk.



## Acid Jazz
*aka:  Jazzdance, Electro Swing, House Jazz, Funk Fusion* in the Downtempo scene, emerged in late 80s

To understand the history of Acid Jazz, you have to understand the history of Rare Groove.

And to do that we have to explore the cultural phenomenon of vinyl collection, specifically as it pertains to the Northern Soul scene that sprung up in the northlands of 60s Britain. See, fifty years ago British youths enamored with American soul records wou... you know what, fuck it. Just go read Last Night A DJ Save My Life if you want to learn about this bundle of history. Go read it right now.
...from a broken heart...
No, really. Go read this book. The guide can wait.
So to sum things up this all led to something called the Rare Groove movement where obsessive vinyl hunters shifted their attention to finding "those rare grooves" that could be used for sampling, with a heavy emphasis on Funk, Soul, Disco, and Jazz.
Naturally the rarer the groove you unearthed the more boss you were among your peers, and hunters needed outlets to show off their treasured artifacts to wily audiences. While by no means popular compared to the discotheques of the day, there was enough interest in this 'club jazz' sound that a couple specialized labels started promoting the stuff, sometimes with re-isssues but mostly supporting newer stuff inspired by the old Rare Grooves.
Most prominent of these labels was one created up by Eddie Piller and Gilles Peterson in 1987 called Acid Jazz. So prominent, in fact, that the music they played out was getting tagged as such. Never mind that Acid Jazz wasn't all that jazzy (it had more in common with Funk and Soul from the Rare Groove scene), and it contained precious little acid.
The name was a riff on the emergence of Acid House in the UK and through some fault of their own the label stuck. Imagine if that had happened with other genres: Names derived from the most famous labels. Acid House would be known as Trax. Atmospheric Jungle would be known as Good Looking. Westcoast Rap would be known as Death Row. Euro Deep House would be known as UMM. 90s Ambient would be known as Fax +49-69/450464.
Despite the name Acid Jazz (the music) never caught onto rave culture like the rest of electronic music at the turn of the 90s. Rather it kept to itself within urban lofts, jazz joints, cafe houses, and other fashionable enclaves within London's inner neighborhoods.
Is it though? Is it really?
Acid Jazz likes to think that it is smart, cultured dance music, taking elements from proven hip music like obscure Funk and Soul and fusing it with emergent hip music like Deep House and Conscious Rap. And even if it relies on a drum machine, turntable, or sampler for its beats, that doesn't mean it can't throw in a trumpet, saxophone, or piano solo either. In fact, the more live instruments it includes, the better.
That probably makes Acid Jazz one of the least pure electronic music genres in this Guide, but its success essentially kicked off the whole Downtempo scene. It was also one of the most bankable genres for a good chunk of the 90s. Acts like The Brand New Heavies, Corduroy, Incognito, and Jamiroquai (ie: that guy with the hat who could dance backwards on a conveyer belt) doing serious chart damage in the UK.

Before Steam, these would be crappy Flash games on New Grounds.
	

Some Hip Hop groups in the States even took notice, incorporating elements of Acid Jazz into their projects (notably A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, and Guru's Jazzmatazz series). This success eventually smoothed over whatever underground element Acid Jazz once had into a slick, polished machine, and by the late 90s interest in the genre had faded once more authentic "urban downtempo" options became available.
Acid Jazz never went away entirely, although your definition of what constitutes Acid Jazz is likely as malleable as traditional jazz-proper genres go. For simplicity's sake, anything that's relatively dancey within the Downtempo scene fits into the Acid Jazz line which can include Jazzdance, Funk Fusion, House Jazz, and yes: Electro Swing. Fucking Electro Swing.

Electro Swing: When you absolutely, positively, got to out-hipster every motherfucker in your social network; accept no substitutes.(Caravan Palace - Lone Digger)
	

Currently it seems Acid Jazz has disappeared from the spotlight long enough for a new generation to discover Rare Groove music all over again and then add a house beat to it. Like the guy who adds hot sauce to chicken wings as something he invented.
This is not a new thing -- you can find similar sounding records from the early 90s that were tagged Acid Jazz. Even the UK charted one such track into the number one spot, Doop.
Of course, this new stuff couldn't use the old name especially since most jazz in electronic music had gone full-in with Nu Jazz. Swing music was close enough though, and since Electro was the common catch-all at the time, we get Electro Swing, because it is neither Electro nor Swing, in much the same way that Rhode Island is neither a road nor an island.
It's still all just Acid Jazz.
Syk.


## Nu Jazz
*aka:  Future Jazz, Latin Jazz, Ragga Jazz, Afro Jazz* in the Downtempo scene, emerged in early 90s

Nu Jazz is Acid Jazz without the Acid.
...is what you would expect here, but truth be told there never was much Acid in Acid Jazz to begin with. It's sort of like how UK Acid House had little to do with American Acid House, in that the latter was all about tweakin' those little squealy knobs while the former was just a catch-all describing House music being played in UK clubs, 303 optional. But hey, since 'club jazz' wasn't as marketable, Acid Jazz stuck (and for other reasons -- go to Acid Jazz to find out today!).
Rather, Nu Jazz came about when all those Acid Jazz musicians suddenly remembered "Hey, we're jazz musicians!" Fortunately their time spent making Acid Jazz gave them some new sonic tricks like sampling, synth effects, dubbing, ambienting, and all the notes they don't play. Thus they took some of the cool, hip toys for themselves and got back to making jazz again.
What jazz musicians making Jazz might look like.
There are other sonic markers that jazz scholars (yes, those exist) like to indicate as instrumental in the development of Nu Jazz including the works of Jon Hassel, Bugge Wesseltoft, and Miles Davis, because it always comes back to Miles Davis. But mostly it was 90s electronic-fusion that got the ball rolling. And because it sounded so different from the staunch traditional stuff of yore it could only be regarded as something new, or Nu. But not Gnu.
Strangely (or not), Jazz purists were initially very resistant to this Nu genre, leaving Nu Jazz wandering a no-man's Venn's Diagram land between the vast continents of Jazz and Electronic music. Not like they couldn't have predicted such a thing happening. Way back when synthesizers were growing more common, purists balked when musicians like Herbie Hancock and Bill Laswell took up electronic instrumentation which was the biggest betrayal since Dylan went Electric.
Labels who had supported Acid Jazz and other forms of Downtempo had no problem getting up on that Nu Jazz business (Wall Of Sound,  Ninja Tune, Quango, Acid Jazz).
Some of it even caught onto the public though almost strictly in lounges, lofts, and Leuven cafes. It also made for handy soundtrack fodder whenever a euro-chic scene was required. Rainy streets, inch long ash hanging off a cigarette, black coffee growing cold, and Nu Jazz softly playing in the distance. There's your arthouse movie, cinemaphiles.
Cinemaphiles burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating Jazz.
By the turn of the century, and with Acid Jazz almost completely receding from interest, Nu Jazz took over as the de facto urban cool sound. Musicians previously simmering in obscurity were now suddenly gaining all the spotlights as cafe culture exploded across the globe (thanks, Starbucks).
This naturally led to a splintering of Nu Jazz into your usual assortment of micro-genres based on tone and location: Spaced out Future Jazz, big bossa-nova beat Latin Jazz, bop-band Ragga Jazz, Afro-funk flip-floppin' jazz, Indo-Celt smooth-Moogly woogly jazz, and whatever it is Flying Lotus is doing on his next album. It must be good because he keeps getting all those Real Jazz Musicians on his records, officially making his jazz accepted by the High Class Jazz Society Of New Cool Diggin' Soul-Bop Consortium (one of the lesser known of the great music Consortiums).
Are all these genres daunting to dive into? Yeah, welcome to Jazz. You have to be a Jazz guy to get into all this Jazz. And that requires a total commitment.

Like this only replace "orgy" with "Jazz" and "lotion" with wine. And "orgy friends" with "Jazz friends". See, a total commitment.
	

I've found the Saint-Germain-des-Pres Cafe series from Wagram Music a handy jumping point (not hosted by the Nu Jazz artist St. Germain). It kicks off just as Nu Jazz was gaining steam and carried on for fifteen years after. You're bound to find something to dig into there, and if not, maybe give Handsup a try instead (no, seriously don't).
Syk.


# Urban

## Funk
*aka:  Electrofunk, Electro Funk, Synth-Funk, Funktronica, Future Funk* in the Urban scene, emerged in early 70s

Funk music started out in the 1970s as something black guys would occasionally perform while wearing capes, jamming on synthesizers and laying out long, noodly basslines while singing about spaceships and elves. It is the coolest music ever.
This contrasts with Progressive Rock which also started out in the 1970s as something white guys would occasionally perform while wearing capes, jamming on synthesizers and laying out long, noodly basslines while singing about spaceships and elves. It is the dorkiest music ever.
Since this is an electronic music guide and not an all music guide, the emphasis here is on the electronic side of Funk with the synthesizers and the fuzz boxes and the occasional vocoders and not the chicken scratch guitar riffs and wah wah grooves that emerged fully formed from the impeccable session musicians of James Brown like Aphrodite emerging from the foam of the sea.
Not to say that chicken scratch guitar riffs and wah wah grooves aren't proper Funk. They most certainly are. But as much as I love the acoustic side of Funk, it's not going to be here. This guide emphasizes only the electronic Funk.
Patrick Gleeson and Herbie Hancock work the Moog modular.
The electronic side of Funk started with Moog (unless it was ARP, or perhaps Yamaha, or maybe Sequential Circuits, or probably Korg).
Like their Prog Rock contemporaries, Funk musicians (as well as Jazz, Soul and R&B) were always on the lookout for new sounds and textures, especially if it was funky. But where the white man used synthesizers for jamming, the black man used synthesizers for "jammin on the one" -- that is, come in hard on the first beat of every bar -- which is the bassis (sic - pun intended) of all Funk music. Here, I'll let Bootsy explain it:

Jammin on the one
	

Electronic music had never really been funky before. No one was sure what would happen to the spacetime-continuum if someone just up and decided to make it funky. Could we really survive a visit from the mothership? Or would our high platform shoes and star-shaped neon glasses protect us? How would we react in this new world that simultaneously urges us to "get on down" and "get on up" with our bad selves? And what if the roof is torn off? Or worse yet, catches fire?
As it turns out, Funk was one of the first things electronic music started to do, after it got past its weird avant-garde experimental dorky white European phase. Once again, the black man saves humanity from becoming a race of boring dunces.
I don't think the Ohio Player's Club were trying to do anything important when they made The Funky Worm. The song itself is quite silly. But at the 45 second mark something magical happens: Keyboardist Junie Morrison whips out his secret weapon, an Arp Pro Soloist, and hammers out an old snake charm shanty.

What an Arp Pro Soloist might sound like.
	

It's something so weird, so off-putting, and so damn funky that it (along with Atomic Dog) became the special ingredient in Westcoast G-Funk 20 years later. It might very well be the most recognized Funk sample that's not a drum break or vocal tic.
After this point Funk could not deny the glorious opportunities presented by early analog synths despite many of them flawed, complicated to work with, limited in scope, and containing numerous defects like a tendency to drift out of tune and out of sync. It's like getting a new car -- it can't go very far or very fast and it keeps listing to one side of the road, but it looks impressive and no one else has one.
Funk bands in the 70s were large ensemble outfits with some of them reaching members of 20 or more, all of them on stage at once. Synthesizers made the recording process simpler and cheaper. Why hire a horn or string section when you can simply overdub a synth? Also: Horns and strings were dominated by watered down oversaturated commercialized white Disco, something that black Funk was eager to distance itself from.
By the 80s, the reliance on electronic gear led to the genre that is the focus here: Electrofunk, or Synth-Funk. It technically predated Electro, but it didn't get the name until Afrika Bambaataa put Electro into the public know-space. That happens sometimes.
While 70s Funk was defined as a loosey-goosey vibe of psychedelics, outrageous outfits, and jam band theatrics, 80s Funk was tighter, classier, better dressed and more focused. Less hippies and more yuppies, like everything else in the 80s. Less Parliament and more Prince.
Or his arch-nemesis: Morris Day and the Motherfuckin' Time.
Of course Funk is still around today although people keep calling it a bunch of dumb new names like Future Funk or Post Funk or Nu Funk or even the cringeworthy Funktronica (because for some stupid reason people think genres need a new name every five years or so). And although most of its ideas have been pilfered and live on in other scenes including House, Hip Hop, Urban and Electro, real Funk is timeless. You can never go wrong returning to the source.

Funky Chimes, the end credits to Sesame Street, is very likely the first song I ever fell in love with. So me and Funk go back a long ways.
	

Ish.


## New Jack Swing
*aka:  R&B, Urban, House Party Soundtrack* in the Urban scene, emerged in late 80s

Janet Jackson probably started this one.
You could probably make an argument for earlier stuff like Vanity 6 - Nasty Girl or Klymaxx - Meeting in the Ladies Room or any early thing by Prince/The Time, but you'd be wrong.
(an aside: Is it me or was Nasty Girl the 80s stripper anthem? It didn't matter what strip club you walked into or saw on some 80s buddy cop movie, if it wasn't Motley Crue playing it was this song. Every decade has a stripper anthem. This decade it's Flo Rida - GDFR)
The name itself is peculiar, but not if you break down its origins. It was indeed 'New' at the time. 'Jack' was already a well-worn House term that became so infectious it was bound to be ripped off by other scenes in much the same way everything was 'wave' in the early 80s or 'step' in the early 00s or 'wave' in the mid 10s. And Swing? I suppose the rhythm was syncopated to give it a 'swing' feel but in truth I'm just spitballing here.
It was probably coined by Teddy Riley so go ask him. Certainly no one called it that when it emerged but the name somehow stuck by 1990 and it was a fitting name for something that was an indisputable potpourri of music genres.
New Jack Swing was a pop accessible fusion of everything that was happening in the mid to late 80s -- Funk, Soul, R&B, Rap, House, Hip House, Freestyle, sampling, orchestral hits, synchronized dancing, tinny drum machines, Sonic the Hedgehog -- into one glorious pot of magic brew stirred by the Macbeth witches.
It got really famous really fast with no underground current to propel it and its biggest proponents -- Jellybean, Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam (and other people with Js in their names) & Terry Lewis, Paula Abdul, New Edition -- were already mega-stars in their own right so anything they made and released was automatic super mega-platinum.
The high top fade: The hairstyle of choice for New Jack Swing.
For three (or four) glorious years New Jack Swing held the world by ransom, peaking with Bel Biv Devoe - Poison in 1990. Every hip movie that wanted to be cool and hip (ie: marketed to teenager), from Ghostbusters 2 to Rocky V, had New Jack Swing in its soundtrack. Even New Jack City -- it's right there in the name.
But no discussion of New Jack Swing movies would be complete without mentioning House Party, the gold standard of New Jack Swing movies. This includes its sequels. If you get the chance, check out House Party 4. It makes House Party 3 look like House Party 2.
You're probably giggling but seriously New Jack Swing was the shit in the early 90s (even the Italians tried their hand at making some). Everyone who listened to it had a high top fade and watched A Different World and Arsenio Hall on TV. It was even used to sell toys to suburban white kids:

I still have no idea what a Balzac is. Is it anything like Happy Fun Ball? 
	

Unfortunately the genre was short-lived as its reliance on tinny drum machines made it very dated very quickly. Don't believe me? Compare Michael Jackson's Thriller album with his Bad and Dangerous albums. The Disco/Funk/R&B-infused former is five years older yet the New Jack Swing-infected latters have dated horribly. It's that blasted gated reverb on the drums. And the music was just better. No one was playing Jam or In the Closet when Michael died. But Baby Be Mine and TLC have aged like fine wine.
So New Jack Swing did not last long, probably because it was swiftly co-opted by white people. And when the New Kids On The Block are co-opting your music style, it's time to get a new music style.
New Jack Swing never stood a chance.
I should probably also mention that I wrote this piece in its entirety while watching Coming to America.
Ish.


## Soul
*aka:  Nu Soul, Neo Soul, Contemporary Soul* in the Urban scene, emerged in Probably the 1950s but electronic instrumentation did not show up until the 80s

Soul is the ballad side of  R&B. Or at least that's how things turned out.
A lot of R&B artists do both but whereas R&B is meant for the clubs Soul is meant for romantic candlelight dinners, awkward dances at prom where you don't really know how to dance with a girl so you just kind of rock back and forth like a rusty gate, and also laying down your soulmate beside a roaring fire on a leopard-skin rug and making sweet, passionate love all night long.
R&B can sing about all manner of things including love, relationships, politics, and especially female pride and empowerment, but Soul is devoted to love. Not sex, but love. The classy kind of love that rich people do with expensive champagne and lobster/steak dinners and all the other amenities, as opposed to the grimy drunken bathroom stall love that Dirty South Rappers enjoy.
Like R&B, Soul music predates electronic music entirely, tracing its origins back to the "Race Music" category on the Billboard charts during the age when woman wore their hair like beehives. The word itself still has ethnic connotations -- just stick "soul" in front of something and it instantly becomes a black people term, like soul food, soul train, soul plane, soul man, soul glo, soul survivor, soul mate, soul caliber, soul certified public accountant, soul nuclear physicist, etc.
Soul music is a scene onto itself. It has tons of genres including Blue Eyed Soul, Philly Soul, Memphis Soul, Detroit Soul (aka Motown), Psychedelic Soul, Chicago Soul, New Orleans Soul, Northern Soul (that stuff's from England), Quiet Storm, but none of them are here because they're not electronic. What you are listening to is Contemporary Soul, better known as Neo Soul or Nu Soul and is the furthest removed from the original Soul sound of gospel/choir music with secular lyrics. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
No discussion of Soul music is complete without the greatest Soul song of all time:

Featuring Darryl Jenks, the Justinian of jheri curls
	

Soul is the go-to genre for singing auditions in television talent competitions like The Voice or American Idol or America's Got Talent or The Masked Singer or The American Singer America Can't Stop Singing or America Sings Too Fucking Much or Who's Got The Mothafuckin' Pipes Bitch? Either this or Celine Dione.
In all honesty if you want to stand out on a talent competition, don't cover Whitney Houston or Aretha Franklin. Just don't. The judges will always compare it to the original and I don't care how good you think your singing is, you're not Whitney Houston. You cannot sing like her. No, you can't. Just don't.
Instead, pick a famous song by a musician who can't sing very well and make it your own. There are plenty of great musicians out there who are mediocre singers like Tom Petty, Don Henley, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Paul Anka, Paul Stanley (starting to see a pattern here) -- their songs are great but their singing is crap. Surely you can do much better than them.
It also shows inventiveness if you can "ballad-ize" a rock song, giving it different texture and meaning as a Soul cover. You may even do it so well that the original artist gives up ownership of the song, like when Joe Cocker covered The Beatles, or when Johnny Cash covered Nine Inch Nails, or when William Shatner covered Elton John. Yeah: You could be famous just like that.
Either that or the national anthem which admittedly is a hard song to sing (spanning a full octave and a fifth), but I wouldn't recommend it either because Whitney sang it too. And also every other R&B and Soul artist. Until you're in front of a crowd of 50,000 at a College Bowl game keep that shit on lockdown.
This is a protip from the Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium.
Ish.


## Reggaeton
*aka:  Latin R&B* in the Urban scene, emerged in mid 00s

Reggaeton is what happens when Dancehall and RB hook up during Spring Break in Cancun.
It didn't start out that way. Almost no crossover genre ever does. Reggaeton has its earliest roots in the early 90s as a Latin-Rap hybrid in Puerto Rico clubs with Jamaican Dancehall flavor.
It was also highly controversial, attracting the same obscenity laws and government crackdowns that Rap endured in the States due to its obscene lyrics and content. Except even more so because the police in the Caribbean have special ways of enforcing laws that just aren't possible in the litigious-conscious United States. Raiding record stores, confiscating tapes, issuing fines, imprisoning business owners -- essentially treating the music like drugs. Naturally this made the music even more popular.
Here we see Police in oppressive Communist Cuba arresting innocent Reggaeton artists because their country doesn't have the same freedoms that we enjoy.(Just kidding. It's American ICE agents rounding up brown people)
As Puerto Rico is an American territory (note: may no longer be valid after October 2017), the music found its way to American clubs along the eastern seaboard filled with Puerto Rican transplants. It didn't stay an underground trend for long as a wave of Latin American hype had been aggressively invading the US mainland for much of the turn of the century. For those who dug the vibe of Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony but wanted something more rugged and real, Reggaeton was there to fill the void.
It was especially picked up by a Queens rapper by the name of Noreaga who had some success churning out typical Eastcoast gangsta rap during the 90s. Following some time in jail and a change of name to N.O.R.E., he realized obeying old Hip Hop tropes meant a short lifespan and an even shorter career.
Taking a cue from R&B, Noreaga found himself a popular singer to belt the hook -- in this case, another Puerto Rican descendent in Nina Sky -- and recorded a single that propelled Reggaeton out of the clubs and into mainstream American consciousness. Oye Mi Canto indeed (I have no idea what that means).
This set the stage for what became the Reggaeton template: Latin rapper, Latin R&B singer, and that distinctive Latin rhythm commonly known as the Dem Bow, a groove so bright, summery, and infectious, even you will try to shake your hips like Shakira. Yes, you, sitting in your chair, or reading this on the bus. A bounce so easy and fun even white college girls in the Kootenays in British Columbia will drunkenly swivvle about to it. Latin America always has the funnest rhythms, even when it's stuff as stupid as the Macarena.
Despite its name Reggaeton doesn't have much to do with real Reggae. This is is a Latin form of music, not Jamaican. People confuse the two because both originate from the same area of the world and Americans are terrible at geography. It'd be like mistaking Chicago House and New York Garage as the same thing. And who would be so stupid as to do that?
But just when you thought Reggaeton had faded from popularity like every other single purpose Latin fad (see: Menudo, Gloria Estefan, Lambada, Macarena, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez), along comes Despacito, which wouldn't have been enough to push it back onto the charts by itself until he vomited all over it. So I guess Reggaeton is going to stay awhile.
And it's all thanks to Puerto Rico: The little island that somehow still can.
Syk.


## R&B
*aka:  Rhythm & Blues, Contemporary R&B* in the Urban scene, emerged in Probably the 1930s, but early 80s for the electronic stuff.

R&B stands for Rhythm and Blues but no one has called it that since probably the 60s.
Rhythm & Blues predates the existence of electronic music entirely. It's so old the Billboard charts labelled it "Race Music" back in the day (and by back in the day I mean pre-war. The one against the Germans) as a catchall for music black people made. Now they call it "Urban" which I guess is progress in a way.
For the purposes of this guide, this genre only covers the modern form of Contemporary R&B derived from Soul, Funk and Hip Hop, as opposed to classic R&B that actually gave rise to Soul, Funk and Hip Hop. And of that sort, only the R&B that employs overt electronic instrumentation which could be any time after 1970 but wasn't really a common thing until the post-Disco era.
Without a doubt R&B is easily the biggest genre in electronic music and quite possibly the biggest genre of all music. And it's not even close: In terms of sheer album sales, awards won, and money made, R&B crushes all other genres on this guide combined (all 166 of them).
Beyonce alone is more popular than everyone else on this guide put together and this genre also has Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Lauren Hill, Ashanti, Jennifer Lopez, Toni Braxton, Mary J. Blige, Usher, and Alisha Keys coming off the bench to pad their stats. In other words: This is the 1992 US Oympic Basketball Dream Team of music genres.
Patrick Ewing still has a crappy jump shot, tho.
R&B is so dominant its alternative names are "Top40" or even just "pop" -- because that's essentially what it is now. It is pop music, and whenever some other genre becomes pop music, it invariably sounds more like R&B. When you go to a club that lists its music as "Top40" or something non-descript like "club music", this is what you can expect to hear. This, Madonna, and Taylor Swift.
R&B has been so popular for so long that it doesn't even feel like a music genre anymore, but rather like some pop eldritch Lovecraftian horror with ten heads, a hundred eyes and a thousand tentacles, writhing about and dipping its feelers into other genres to sample, taste, and abduct their sounds to feed its cavernous gullet.
It has changed over time and it has adopted styles and techniques from other forms of music but the instrumentation is just for decoration, like parsely on your plate. 
The foundation of R&B has always been the gospel-affected ostentatious divas. That's what people listen to R&B for. That's what teenage girls try to sound like when they audition for American Idol. That's what will get stuck in your head the next day -- the diva vocal hooks. The divas are so important that they're hired to sing acapella in public, especially when they butcher the national anthem at sporting events, trilling their melisma over several octaves and dragging a 40 second upbeat allegro martial tune into a 2.5+ minute adagio funeral dirge.

Like this, but more insipid.
	

If R&B has one problem it's that its divas can become too overpowering. Not just of the music itself but of the music industry, their fame, and their celebrity. At some point they become bigger and more important than their music to the extent that it doesn't matter what they release, it will always go super Diamond Platinum (Kanye West proved this with Life of Pablo which was a rushed, half-assed poorly executed waste of 60 minutes made specifically to see how stupid his fans are. That is what he was doing, right?).
This has the curious affect of extreme wealth inequality in R&B where a few big name artists at the top get all the money, sales, attention, headlines and power, and everyone else is just treading water.
Granted wealth inequality exists in every genre but nowhere is it more evocative than R&B. Divas in R&B can dominate record charts for decades with very little turnover or downturn in their celebrity or album sales. Beyonce is so massive I don't even want to say anything bad about her, except to say that she could probably take a dump in a record sleeve and it would still sell 10 million copies. That's not an indictment of her.
R&B also has its share of copycats as well. That's why Allessia Cara, Tove Lo, Hailee Steinfeld, and Daya all sound like Lorde. Or Billie Eilish -- the answer to the question: What if Lorde was a cutter?
It is hard to evaluate this genre and its music on its own terms when its divas outshine the music so much. But I want to emphasize that this guide's goal is to put the music first, and if it has a bias it is always toward obscure, hidden or underground gems that are often overlooked or have gone unnoticed because their album was released the same week as a Beyonce album. Because no one is more important than the music.
Not even Queen Bey.

Ish.

# UK Garage

## 2-Step Garage
*aka:  UK Garage* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in late 90s

2-Step Garage is the heir apparent to Speed Garage, which is like saying colon cancer is the heir apparent to ischemic colitis.
I like to think that the conversation between UK fashion designers, restauranteers, and satellite radio jocks over how to make the hot n hip new underground Garage sound palatable for grandmothers and 8-year-olds went something like this:
"We like the DnB basslines, but do you have anything with less aggressive drums in it?"
"Why certainly. Here you go."
"Oh, and get rid of the angry black Jamaican man. Too ethnic. Do you have anyone more... y'know.... British?"
"How about a drunken Eastender with a cockney th-fronting accent?"
"That'll do. So what do you call this music?"
"2-step Garage."
I should emphasize that this is the point in the Garage scene where Garage stops being Garage and starts being "Garage". It's all in the pronunciation. The Brits say it like "carriage". Because people in Britain -- the land of 400 accents per Guy Ritchie movie -- can't pronounce English properly anymore.

English is the only language that needs an English-to-English-to-English translator.
	

Replacing the 4-to-the-floor kick with downtempo breakbeats but keeping the dumb basslines was a harbinger of things to come, as it acclimated its audience to a style of jittery, arhythmic percussion that would later come to define -- and dominate -- the scene's dumbassery. How can one not see Dubstep emerging from this pile of steaming fecal matter? That black hole is getting closer and spaghettification is a certainty.
But the key selling point of this specific genre was women. Like a lot of UK Garage genres, 2-step got its start as a lowkey downtempo swanky sound for Drum n Bass chill rooms. But over the years Drum n Bass had transmogrified into an angry and misogynistic white male frat genre, to the point where promoters started noticing a lack of women at DnB shows. And that needed to change.
The solution was 2-Step Garage. Emphasizing this nicer, less agro non-DnB variant into DnB clubnights would entice the ladies to come back. At least that was the theory.
The one crucial ingredient missing was R&B style diva vocals (like Beyonce), because girls love R&B divas (especially Beyonce). That's a protip: If you get R&B divas (I'm speaking of Beyonce) in your music genre, the lineup for the girls restroom will stretch outside to the street all night. There's just something about R&B divas (ie: Beyonce) that causes a dancefloor frenzy like dumping a cow carcass into piranha-infested waters. Women love Beyonce like the Pope loves shitting in the woods.
R&B and 2-step Garage each took note of the crossover appeal and for a few years the two genres were indistinguishable. Both loved abusing the hell out of that punchy shuffle snare hit, so tight it sounds like a rimshot "thock". The relationship was short-lived, however, as the black hole of UK Garage pulled 2-Step from its brief fling with R&B like an overprotective father with a shotgun terminating his teenage daughter's date with extreme prejudice.
Four years later, 2-Step would be all but devoured whole by the Dubstep singularity. Beyond this point there is only unholy eldritch madness. And quite possibly a breakdown in the laws of physics as we know it.
Ish.



## Grime
*aka:  2-Step Rap* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in early 00s

I actually have a lot of respect for Grime.
It is a UK Garage genre proper, but more importantly it is the UK's first homebrewed, fully native, 100% British Hip Hop genre.
UK Hip Hop has existed for decades but it has always been a sly emulation of American Hip Hop (continuing a long-standing tradition beginning with the British invasion of Rock n Roll in the 60s through Northern Soul in the 70s and UK Techno in the 80s and 90s, of Brit musicians making American music).
Throughout the 80s and 90s UK Hip Hop did everything it could to pretend that it was American Hip Hop, from wearing Adidas and gold chains to hiding their accents behind Harlem, Mid-Atlantic, and Southern dialects. They had to pretend they were gangstas from the hard streets of American inner cities which wasn't much of a handicap since most American rappers had to do the same.
It wasn't until the late 90s that British rappers began slowly pulling away from the heavy influence of American Hip Hop but they still didn't have a fully realized self-contained genre to call their own. It was simply US Hip Hop with funny accents. They had no native cultural identity.
Right: Dizzee Rascal, a guy who makes Grime. Left: Russell Brand, a guy who listens to Grime and a stupid person's idea of what a smart person sounds like.
Enter Grime: A genre made by, for, and about lower class black people in the UK rapping about their personal experiences, which is invariably going to be different than lower class black people in the US rapping about their personal experiences. It's still music coming from the streets, they're just different streets. The kind of streets that have a robust welfare state and universal healthcare.
So black people are better off in the UK, which means they'll rap about different things. Less about drugs and gangs, and more about where they should go for lunch:

I dunno how much 1 pound 50 pence is, but it sounds like a good deal.
	

Grime is the genre that gave us the infamous low frequency oscillation also known as the "wub". There are probably some 2-Step tracks that have it, but Grime is what really pushed it into the foreground. The lyrical content (if you can understand it, not like anyone can understand East End accents anyway) might be about being on the dole, or about hanging out with geezers in the pubs before going out to the clubs.
Grime has waxed and waned in popularity over the years, coming and going like... well, like a low frequency oscillation. Some keen producers took note that if the tempo was dropped and the lyrics removed, the scene can be driven to new, yet unheard of levels of popular suckage but with greater appeal because the rapping gets in the way sometimes.
And what is Dubstep, really, but just instrumental Grime?
Ish.


## Future Garage
*aka:  Post Garage, Chillstep, Future Bass, Atmospheric Dubstep, Intelligent Garage, Ambient Garage, UK Bass, Downtempo Dubstep, Downtempo Garage, Progressive Garage, Nu Garage* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in late 00s

Hegelian Dialectics suggests that for every thesis (ie: trend, fad, or popular groundswell), an anti-thesis emerges to oppose it, sometimes purely out of spite.
This explains how the most popular artists have the loudest and most angry haters. It is a repulsion of the zeitgeist, a kneejerk reaction to the prevailing winds. Disco saw it in the 70s, Hair Metal saw it in the 80s, and Dubstep saw it in the late 00s.
Not everyone is happy when their chosen field has suddenly become commercial. Some, in fact, are positively appalled by it. They immediately seek a more underground place where the mainstream can't get at them (and there's no genre, field or industry that stays underground forever. To be underground is to be in a state of constant digging).
And of course this new place needs a new name to identify it as something distinct from the commercial crap that ruined the genre. And the name needs to indicate that it is somehow better and more evolved than the pop mainstream version so it uses epithets like Post, Future, Deep, Progressive, Intelligent, or Nu.
In the future no one will have Garage.
This is one of those genres. They call it Future Garage officially but it has like a dozen names and any one of them are apt. It really just sounds like shitty easy-listening Dubstep muzak made by people determined to not make it popular because to some people elitism is more important than making good music and they don't want you to like theirs. If they notice that you do they will change it to something you don't. Or at least have never heard of.
The best way to make non-mainstream music is to not have any hooks, anthems, or vocals in your tracks. And make it not dancefloor worthy so it's more of a coffeehouse and loungey loft genre rather than a peak hour festival banger genre.
You're probably waiting for me to say it so here it is: It's all because of this album.
Relax, I don't have anything bad to say about Burial. I don't have anything good to say about Burial, but I don't have anything bad to say.
For a genre that's trying to stay underground, Burial - Untrue probably received far more attention and hype than it deserved but that wasn't Burial's fault. It just became that One Very Important Album that every music magazine singled out as super good because music magazines cover only a fraction of what's actually out there and they don't know any better. There is probably far more interesting Future Garage than Burial but how would you know that if your favorite magazine doesn't tell you about it?
This is why music magazines are dumb. Stop reading them or relying on them to tell you what's good, and go exploring on your own. Not that I'm implying Burial's album isn't a seminal piece of work, but would you really have given a shit if the magazines didn't also give a humongous shit?
Record charts in general are dumb. Are they really trying to tell me what music to like? That's stupid. Following record charts is just something I will never understand. I mean I understand, I just don't get it. I mean I get it, I just can't fathom it. I mean I fathom it, it just doesn't make any sense to me. I mean I can make sense of it, it just doesn't register with me at all. I mean I register with it, it just fails to have any sort of effect.
This genre has probably already split into many subgenres, each one trying to redeem what remains of the post-Dubstep UK Garage scene's shattered reputation. Just don't call any of it Dubstep. They really hate that.
You should probably not call it Future Garage either.
Ish.


## Dubstep
*aka:  Post Garage, Intelligent Garage, UK Bass, Future Bass, Riddim* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in early 00s

You ever have one of those really sticky poos where you've pinched it off but it's clinging to your sphincter for dear life, and you don't want to get up and wipe because that would take a lot of toilet paper, so you just kinda sit there helpless, and maybe wiggle around a bit to try and shake it off?
And then after a few minutes gravity does its job and the turd finally detaches from your rectum and drops into the bowl with a satisfying ker-plunk?
Well guess what: They make music like that now.
Whenever anyone asks me if I like Dubstep, I always reply "No, I don't do Ketamine." Dubstep cultivates a style of spastic, arrhythmic gyrations and seizure-like stabbing of extremities that can only come about from a heavy dose of horse tranquilizers.

Dubstep is basically halftime Grime and 2-Step, with maybe some light Dub flavoring (and when I say light I mean light mayonnaise light -- this is a genre that went from the London black underground to offensively white Canadian frat dickheads within a nanosecond).
In the early period they called it Dark Garage. It was a rubbery LFO sound that had a tendency to go from double time to half time -- sometimes within the same bar -- making the genre feel as if time is being stretched and squeezed, which is why it finds favor with users of disassociatives. Ketamine warps time and makes your legs rubbery. It's also used on fucking horses.
Around 2006 Dubstep picked up influences from Ed Banger style Filthy Electrohouse and Tigerbeat6 style Glitch cf. Kid606 whose shows always reeked of hipsters because Vice Magazine wouldn't shut the fuck up about him.
Like all UK Garage genres (with the exception of Speed Garage) Dubstep was beloved by the Drum n Bass scene where it was first used as an enjoyable second room/chill area at their jungle parties until it eventually took over the main room. That's like inviting a homeless person to crash at your place out of charity but they decide to stay, sleeping in your bed and eating all your food.
By 2008, these influences -- Drum n Bass, Glitch and Electrohouse -- grabbed Dubstep, dragged it behind an alleyway and violently anal raped it no less than 23 times. 
From this traumatic experience Dubstep jacked up the lower mid range, kept the LFO wubs but applied them to screeching, squelching synth lines and this attracted the unsavory frathouse crowd who were already into the electro stuff anyway. It also stopped doing the weird tempo thing, choosing to be half time all the time. Before long they were calling this mutant offspring Brostep which is a name that tells you everything you need to know about how utterly hideous it is.
People prayed for a savior out of this noisey wub garbage and their prayers were answered in the form of a Skrillex, which is like being on fire and begging someone to put it out and they come at you with a tank of gasoline.
The arrival of Skrillex -- the Nickelback of electronic music -- harkened the death of funky beats in the main room for half a decade. Copycats scrambled to make music that didn't sound like Dubstep but sounded like Skrillex. Music software manufacturers rushed to develop plugins that made the Skrillex sound. Memes proliferated on the Internet in cartoons and captions. If you grew up in this era and this is your jam, you are an objectively bad person who listens to objectively bad music.
For a few years "Dubstep" (technically Brostep) went mainstream. It was in movie trailers and car commercials. It was at Grammy Awards and high school football halftime shows. It was used to sell blue jeans and the last version of Internet Explorer:

This is what the pop industry does to your precious underground music scene
	

Dubstep attracted a class of people to parties who never should have paid attention to electronic music in the first place.
And then as quickly as it came, it was gone. This is something the mainstream does all the time: Poach an electronic music genre, sell a watered down pop version of it to grandmothers and 8-year-olds, and then discard the desiccated husk when it's done. I even predicted it:
note: Art not mine, just the copy. This was originally an EA gag. If you are the artist let me know so I can credit you properly.
So thoroughly did Skrillex skidmark his influence all over Dubstep -- which in the public consciousness came to associate with anything that sounded like him -- that it had become a dirty word. Not since "Techno" has a music scene been forced to abandon an entire word. It'll still be another 10 years before Dubstep can be reclaimed by the undergound.
Dubstep still exists today, if only in hushed tones. Its progeny have a bevvy of alternative names for it: Post Garage, Future Garage, Intelligent Garage, UK Bass, Future Bass, Riddim, whatever boring thing Burial is doing. But it's still all Dumbstep.
Ish.


## Brostep
*aka:  Dubstep, Deathstep, Horrorstep, Metalstep, Evilstep, Vomitstep* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in late 00s

Brostep is one of the most offensive things to happen to music in recent memory, second only to Robin Thicke's career. It's so offensive it's a Cards Against Humanity expansion pack.
It is hard to think of a statement or policy position that can be more offensive than Brostep. If you've ever held the view that black people were better off as slaves, or that women should earn less than men because they're weaker and less intelligent, or that sex with children is okay as long as the child consents, then your views are hot garbage -- Brostep may be right for you. You are almost as offensive as the music.
It's terrifying how much Brostep resembles a plague. For one, it is inherently parasitical. It has no native essence by itself. Much like a virus, which cannot survive on its own and must propagate by taking over living cells and rewrite their DNA to produce more viruses, Brostep is a fiercely aggressive sound assault that thrives on invading existing music and implant itself as the song's hook (or in Brostep terminology "the drop"), which comes out sounding like the audio equivalent of a cancerous growth (especially if you hear one of those stage 4 drops).

Deadpool 2's "Dubstep" scene. There's just one problem: That's not Dubstep or even Brostep, that's latter day Electrohouse with Dubstep barks.
	

Brostep is a herpe sore on the upper lip of electronic music. It is loud, crude, violent, misogynistic, moloko plus-fueled, underage gang rape music. It is self-entitled, come-at-me-bro, white nationalist, jersey shore douchebag elbowing you in the face music. It is homophobic, transphobic, chauvinistic, baseball hat wearing, alt-right MRA calling you a cuck on Twitter music.
Brostep is not even technically music. It is a music technique, a short-snippet audio aesthetic that is barely enough to constitute a genuine genre. It is jacked up on texture, timbre, resonance and blistering midrange frequencies rather than actual harmony, melody and rhythm.
It even smells like Axe body spray for fuck's sakes.
Everything about Brostep is a god damn lie.
People call it "bass" music when it has no bass. Those are ear-splitting mid range frequencies popularized only because the primary listening devices of today's generation are crappy ipod earbuds or even crappier laptop speakers (or worse yet, ipads and iphones), which are small and contain no dynamic range. The bass has been marginalized because most people can't hear it through their pitiful systems. The midranges have been turned up to headache-inducing levels to compensate.

Brostep has one good track: Charlie Sheen's raging cokehead rant.
	

Brostep cannot create, it can only corrupt. Every other form of appalling music is at least redeemable by laying it out in a different arrangement or style. You cannot do this with Brostep. There is nothing you can add to it or change to make Brostep better. If you attach violin to Brostep, it just makes violin worse.
Brostep is the singularity of the UK Garage black hole -- a void of utter nothingness where no music can escape, not even light jazz. Beyond this point there is only crushing oblivion.
It's probably this guy's fault.
And no, don't give me that "it used to be good but now it sucks" nonsense. It was always this bad, you just didn't know any better. Give your head a shake.
Brostep is the Nu Metal of electronic music, courting meatheads and fratfucks at festivals, thrashing about in mosh pits and shouting "RIDE THE RAIL" like train enthusiasts (those guys are super hardcore).
Brostep has spawned a number of subgenres which amplify the hideousness to cartoonish extremes: Deathstep, Horrorstep, Metalstep, Evilstep, Stupidshitheadstep. None of it is cool anymore.
If you got into Brostep back in the Skrillix "era" and you're still listening to Brostep today, seriously what's wrong with you? Delete your account(s). The only useful thing you'll contribute to humanity is your body when you die, recycled into fuel for the living. You might as well have a bar-code stamped on your forehead you worthless serf.
Ish.



## Speed Garage
*aka:  Bassline House, Bass House, House Garage* in the UK Garage scene, emerged in late 90s

If you've ever visited my previous guide(s) you might recall that I declared Speed Garage the worst music in the world.
Little did I realize that it was merely the first thrust of an emergent new Scene of music, one of only two born in the 2000s (Eurotrash is the other). With the benefit of hindsight I now see Speed Garage in an entirely different light. You might even call it mild affection.
Don't get me wrong, it's still bad. It just looks good compared to what comes after it. It's like comparing the taste of a shit sandwich to an open-mouthed swim in the city septic tank after all-you-can-eat Taco Friday.
This whole scene -- UK Garage -- is a black hole of shitty arrhythmic dorky white people bass where each new genre gets closer to the crushing singularity. We didn't know it at the time but Speed Garage was merely on the lip of the event horizon of an astral maelstrom of heinous ear cancer.

Speed Garage differs from regular Garage in its affections for Jamaican culture and cliches. Not actual Jamaica, of course, but Jamaican transplants in England (this is a UK genre, after all). Dancehall call and responses, gun shots and other stock reggae sound effects, and of course that stupid bassline which sounds like the school teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoons scolding one of the Peanuts kids for his inability to spit, sing and gargle at the same time.
Some like to point to the 1994 track George Morel - Let's Groove as the originator of the dumb bassline, but he was using the Reese bass -- a rolling bassline that was a big thing in Darkstep at the time -- in a high register for some reason. So you can call that the first Speed Garage track if you like. The Electronic Music Standards and Classifications Consortium will not penalize you for it.
But I prefer Armand van Helden's 1996 Dark Garage (as he called it) remix of Sneaker Pimps - Spin Spin Sugar. This is the track that really set the template for the osmotic anal secretions that would drown the scene in putrid bile in the years to come.
It was the 90s you see...
Speed Garage didn't invent time-stretched vocals but it abused them to the point of nausea. Garage music itself was moving toward a heavier, bassier sound and it is customary in electronic music that when someone comes up with a catchy hook, idea or technique, the next wave of imitators often take it to cartoonish extremes. It's like inventing an ice cream sundae, and the next guy comes along and thinks "If the fudge is everybody's favorite part, why not make a sundae that's all fudge?" So in effect, Speed Garage is like a late 90s parody of what Garage sounded like in the mid 90s.
Speed Garage also did one other thing regular Garage doesn't do: Breakdowns and builds. But hey, it was the 90s and every genre was doing that to some extent (blame Eurotrance. Speed Garage was so popular that it often beat Eurotrance for the peak hour main room slot at massive raves.
Such overexposure and over-reliance on gimmicks meant that it could not possibly last and it didn't. By 2000 Speed Garage had almost dropped off the face of the Earth. All the producers shifted to making 2-Step Garage instead, which is basically just Speed Garage with downtempo breakbeats (and other lousy ideas).
10 years later, however, Speed Garage would make a triumphant yet subtle return as people remembered the goofy gimmicks and stupid sounding basslines and started making it all over again, this time influenced by Dubstep wubs and production gloss. They call it Bassline House or House Garage or Bass House or Dumb Bullshit House for some reason, probably because every generation wants to think that it invented something if it gets to come up with the name for it.
It's still all stupid dumb dopey dumb dumb Speed Garage to me.
Ish.


# Garage/Deep House

## Garage
*aka:  New York Garage, Garage House, Post Disco* in the Garage/Deep House scene, emerged in late 70s

Garage is the true successor to Disco, without much deviation in form, content, or style.
Disco needed a name change anyway. It had been sullied by a very violent backlash. The kind of misguided, rage-filled backlash that elects Donald fucking Trump.
Disco was the whipping term for any and all gay and black music as perceived by the white boy frat rock crowd (the bros and MRAs of the 70s).
Stricken with a sense of lost cultural identity, White Anglo-Saxon Pricks who worshipped Archie Bunker's bigotry in All In The Family because they didn't understand satire were distraught that Disco had taken over everything, even their precious All Boston All The Time FM rock radio stations.
Which it was. I mean, let's be fair: They weren't wrong. The late 70s binged on Disco like Charlie Sheen with an 8-ball of coke. Just about every legendary rock band released a Disco record or at least toyed with its aesthetics at one time or another: Kiss, AC/DC, Pink Floyd, Queen, Neil Young, Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney. It was everywhere, it was popular, and you couldn't find a single radio station that wasn't playing it.
All this animosity culminated in the infamous Disco Demolition Night at Chicago's Comisky Park in July, 1979 -- a radio promotion held between the games of a baseball double header that caused so much damage the second game was forfeit.
It was more than just a bunch of disaffected music fans rebelling against an oversaturated fad. It was cultural warfare. They destroyed more than just Disco records that night. A lot of choice Soul, Gospel, R&B, Quiet Storm, Jazz, Pop, Funk, even Motown and Beach Boys records met their fate in that pyre. If House and Techno existed they probably would've destroyed them too. Disco was anything that wasn't cock rock and therefore deserved to die.
Disco Demolition Night went beyond music. It was a racist, chauvinistic, homophobic, angry white power rally afraid of losing its so-called way of life to "jews, fags, niggers and immigrants". Disco represented the rise of black and gay power, historically two disenfranchised and powerless minorities who had nevertheless become a clear and present threat to the usually dominant white male jockocracy. The response was typical of any ruling group: Put those uppity inferiors back in their place.
This is the tragedy of Disco Demolition Night. And it's a pattern that's re-asserting itself in American politics. But I digress.
What Disco Demolition Night might look like
So Disco stopped being Disco. It started being Garage.
The word Garage doesn't mean anything pertinent other than its name comes from the legendary Paradise Garage nightclub in New York City where DJ Larry Levan would play anything he damn well pleased. Garage music simply meant music that Larry played; music that you would hear at his club. He played Disco, of course, but a stripped down version of it, without the schmaltzy strings and horn fanfares.
Borrowing from the minimalism of Change and Chic and employing new electronic instrumentation, Garage music aimed for a more mature, laidback and refined audience -- likely the same audience that survived the pedal-to-the-metal coked-out insanity of Studio 54 and wanted to downshift their nightlife. Sometimes a keyboard and a bass guitar was the only accompaniment, along with a sexy, sultry voice to guide the groove along. Garage is Disco with Soul.
The Garage sound of New York is often contrasted with the House sound of Chicago. It's just a coincidence that they are both named after residential dwellings. So don't expect there to be any Apartment sound coming out of Philadelphia or Condo in Cleveland. Although the Shack sound of Charlotte is some delicious funky goodness.
Garage didn't officially get its stereotypical "garage" sound until the 90s. It was still technically a Disco-derived sound up until then. At some point in the very early 90s it picked up a distinctive snare shuffle that has since become the stock rhythm pattern for almost all Garage music everywhere (you can probably thank Masters At Work for this although they didn't invent it... it was probably Todd Terry). So if you're ever trying to tell the difference between Garage and House, just listen for that shuffle.
Unlike Chicago House New York Garage is almost never instrumental. It loves divas, light keyboard stabs, and of course that shuffle. It is the smooth jazz of dance music, inoffensive and family-friendly which makes it perfect for stylish advertising, mall clothing stores like Bebe or La Senza, fashion shows, hair and makeup salons, and upscale trendy eateries and night clubs. It is the theme music for South Park's SoDoSoPa recreation and nightlife district:

SoDoSoPa: Where never before has it cost so much to live a less interesting life.
	

Garage also inadvertently gave us Speed Garage, but the good news is it escaped without being overwhelmingly influenced by it probably because the latter was some UK bollocks that Garage just didn't give two shits about and shouldn't, really.
Speaking of the UK: There is a scene called UK Garage which, despite the namesake, actually has precious little to do with actual Garage, in much the same way the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. You can hear the shuffle in Speed Garage and 2-Step but the other derivatives are so utterly alien that it's almost offensive to call any of it Garage. So I suggest a new name: Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis. Go ahead, look that up. I'll wait.
Today what most people think is House music is actually Garage. And what most people think is Garage is some dodgy nonsense the British sharted into their trousers. Someone should really try and set the record straight about that. Like make a guide or something.
Ish.


## US Deep House
*aka:  Tribal House, Soulful House, Jazz House, Dad House* in the Garage/Deep House scene, emerged in late 80s

It should be noted that separating Deep House between European and American variants is my invention only. The actual scene doesn't categorize like that (they actually do it via cities and labels -- the Chicago sound, the Philly sound, the San Franciso sound, etc.) but having a genre for each city would make things crowded and redundant. No one really cares about micro-divisions anyway. It's all Deep House, and when it comes to all Deep House, it's all good.
There is a lot of recent confusion over what Deep House is, so let me just clear some misconceptions.
Real Deep House is supposed to sound as organic as possible without actually being organic. And by organic I don't necessarily mean acoustic but rather the employment of sounds and textures that could come from the real world as opposed to synthesized sounds generated via waveforms, oscillators and envelopes.
The organic sounds could be samples but the best Deep House uses real instruments, the way Jazz and Soul music has been doing it for decades. Instruments like oh I dunno... a Rhodes electric piano.
And you have to know how to play it, too. Because Deep House likes jazz-style solos.
Now, you don't absolutely need a Rhodes piano in your track for it to be authentic Deep House, but it helps. You don't have to use flutes, glockenspiels, congas, double bass, organs, violins, saxophones, trombones or trumpet solos either, but Deep House has these too (either sampled or digitally reproduced).
But the key here is the organic nature of Deep House's sounds. It takes from Jazz and Soul far more than it takes from contemporary House. It can be funky but funk is not its top priority. There is more to being deep than the bass. There's also the groove, the soul, the vibe. And a sultry, bluesy, lounge-singing diva to bring things home. Think more Barry White and less Barry Gibb.
Deep House got its start in -- where else -- Chicago, where Marshall Jefferson and Larry Heard introduced a less anthemic, more subdued version of House music that attracted an upscale crowd. Like everything else in the Midwest in the late 80s, it got exported to Europe with enthusiasm and soon Europe started making its own Deep House with very promising results.
In the 90s some Chicago Deep House converts moved to San Francisco, bringing their soulful sounds with them and establishing the city as Deep House's second founding. The late 90s was the peak era of San Francisco Deep House, led by a lil ole label with naked 70s soul sista pinups on its records.
Music and wine are the only friends of mine.
There are subgenres of Deep House that get even deeper, jazzier, and more soulful. One of my favorites is something I like to call "Dad House", because its liberal employment of walking basslines and saxophone solos evoke images of your dad walking around the house in his bathrobe on a Sunday morning before settling into his favorite chesterfield chair to smoke a pipe and read the newspaper in front of a roaring fire. Well, mine anyway.
Like Garage, Deep House serves an older more mature yuppie clientele who aren't afraid of getting naked on a California beach every weekend. Deep House is yacht music, penthouse music, private island music, expensive alcohol music, smokey speakeasy music. It is classy, clinking wine glass music. It is a genre so addictive and so nice, there needs to be two of them.

Deep House the way it was meant to be Deep House
	

Of course Deep House is still around today, but beware of other genres being mislabled as Deep House, including Progressive, Deeptech, Minimal Tech and Tropical House. All those genres are made by white people and it shows. Deep House is made by white people too, but it doesn't sound like it. And that's the key difference -- Deep House has soul. Those other genres are utterly soulless.
Ish.


## Euro Deep House
*aka:  Tribal House, Balearic House, Glockenspiel House* in the Garage/Deep House scene, emerged in early 90s

It should be noted that separating Deep House between European and American variants is my invention only. The actual scene doesn't differentiate like that (they actually do it via cities and labels -- the Chicago sound, the Philly sound, the San Franciso sound, etc.) but having a genre for each city would make things crowded and redundant. No one really cares about micro-divisions anyway. It's all Deep House, and when it comes to all Deep House, it's all good.
Euro Deep House is largely the Italian sound (especially in the early going), which is odd because when one thinks of Italian music, soulful Deep House is not what immediately comes to mind. Yet they took to the aesthetics really well, proving again my theory that when it comes to European electronic music you can always count on the Italians and Belgians to bring their A-game. But never the Dutch -- they should just stop making music altogether (except for this guy. He cool).
Euro Deep House is very closely linked with US Deep House (of course). But where US Deep House pulled influences from American Soul, Blues and Jazz, Euro Deep House found a similar-but-different model of inspiration: The easy-going vibes of Balearic music. It's also slightly slower and considerably less funky. This makes Euro Deep House not necessarily deep, but more relaxing and chill, because both genres found their form in lazy summer beachbum days.
And that might be the source of the confusion over what is considered "Deep House" these days. People (let's call them white people) are confusing laidback and chill with deep, and that's just wrong. Not that it's bad, just that it's not right. It's like confusing Jimmy Buffett for calypso music -- yes, they're both mellow Caribbean folk tunes, however one is definitely shittier than the other.
Just as US Deep House has its microgenres, Euro Deep House has a ton of them as well. One of my favorites is an early 90s subgenre I call Glockenspiel House (unless it's a Vibraphone, or a Xylophone, or a Marimba, or some other idiophone), because only Deep House would dare put a 3+ minute Glockenspiel solo in the middle of a track and still make it interesting.
But if you really want to know all the superficial differences between the two: Euro Deep House's slightly more minimal arrangement, greater usage of Korg pads (and organ), less reliance on organic basslines, and little things like more busy tribal percussion, spanish guitar, panflutes, of course that glockenspiel, and things like marine mammal calls and crashing waves and seagulls gawking that indicate sweet, soulful Mediterranean vibes as opposed to sweet, soulful San Franciso vibes.
And while US Deep House carries more of an urban R&B vibe right down to the jazz quartet and sultry singer in a dingy nightclub, Euro Deep House is more open and cinematic: Musical vistas, white terraces and patios on wealthy Greek islands, open hills where the music has room to breathe.
What Euro Deep House might look like.
The Europeans definitely convey a level of higher sophistication (read: they have more money) than their US counterparts, but that doesn't make the music any worse or counterfeit. Both complement each other and both are irresistably drawn to the smooth, laidback vibe of a night with good friends and comfortable music.
Yeah, I know. Very subtle. You'll never find a Deep House DJ so picky that he would selectively spin one and not the other.
(note: I do not consider the UK to be Euro, so Brit labels like Paper Recordings, Pagan, Glasgow Underground, Dedicated, and all the rest of it are in the US Deep House section)
And of course Euro Deep House is still around. Why would it go away?
Ish.


# Progressive

## Progressive House
*aka:  Prog House, Epic House, Leftfield, whatever Sasha & Digweed are doing* in the Progressive scene, emerged in early 90s

Progressive House happened when UK House started sounding like its own cohesive thing and not a half-assed attempt by UK producers to make Chicago-sounding Chicago House.
It was probably coined by Genesis Breyer P-Orridge of then Psychic TV to refer to groups like Leftfield who were doing something with House music that didn't really fit the House template (Leftfield was an early name for Progressive House, named specifically after the band. The term is still around however it's pretty much meaningless now).
Progressive House really did kind of earn the name in the early days. It was an extension of House music utilizing ideas and concepts quite divorced from its gay black Chicago origins. Tribal breakbeats via bongos and african log drums, congas and maracas, spanish guitar plucking, ethnic wailing and cheering samples, panflutes, tamborines and shakers, arps and synth stabs, indie rock vocals and electric guitar riffs, and lush pads and choir atmospherics. There was almost no sound or instrument that didn't seem like a good idea to Progressive House.
House music always had an uplifting quality to it, but a subgenre of Progressive House took it one step further, introducing breakdowns and builds and crowd cheering samples as if it was at a rock concert, and anthems from Rave as if was at a rave. This new Stadium or "Anthem House" sound broke away and became its own thing soon afterward, and charted its own non-House path into the world of anthemic Euroweenie music.
There were those who resisted the anthems (and by "those" I mean Sasha and Digweed) as the 90s wore on and if there was any mix that defines the classic Progressive House sound it would be Northern Exposure.
Listening to this mix gives you the true Progressive House experience, which apparently means playing anything other than Progressive House.
In true Progressive House style, Northen Exposure was an exciting blend of Breaks, Techno, Chill Out, Downtempo, Ambient, Balearic, Trance, and very little actual Progressive House.
There is a very small subgenre of Progressive House that existed for a year or two called Epic House, that pretty much bookends the albums BT - Ima and Blue Amazon - The Javelin and not much else. One wonders why nothing else was done with this nitpicking and quite unnecessary lexical deviation from the mean. Genre snobs annoy me.

A better Progressive House mix than Northern Exposure by virtue of the fact that it has actual Progressive House in it
	

Probably the most important thing Progressive House introduced were arps (those looping synth lines that go "doodly doodly doodly" - from arpeggio, the musical technique of playing the notes in a chord in rapid succession instead of all at once). Arps were not new to electronic music (Hi-NRG introduced them back in 1977), but they weren't known to be a House thing.
This didn't really have much of an impact at first but it would later on when Trance took over and the British -- in that typical British way of theirs -- decided that if they owned the Progressive side of House they might as well own the Progressive side of Trance as well. Or maybe just merge the two and call it all Prog.
Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Cuts down on all the confusion.

## Twinkle Prog
*aka:  McProg* in the Progressive scene, emerged in 1999

Twinkle Prog is a pejorative. You will not find this name on any official mixes or CD compilations. But it was used a lot in Prog circles in the early 00s to refer to bad Prog music, which is the exact opposite of what marketers want you to think of it.
Twinkle Prog can trace its origins to one track and that track is Sasha - Xpander.
And some other forgettable singles.
With the exception of McProg and its fromage-based derivatives, Sasha & Digweed control the narrative of this entire scene in much the same way your crazy racist uncle controls Thanksgiving dinner conversation.
Twinkle Prog was still Prog, it was just Prog that took the slightly monotonous dubby Bedrock sound and added some twinkly melodies to it (hence the name). You could make the argument that it doesn't technically exist but we gotta blame James Holden for something. And to a lesser extent Andy Moor. At least early on. And maybe Markus Schulz and Dave Dresden too. But not Josh Gabriel because only Dresden was thin-skinned enough to attack his detractors online. Dumbass.
That's a protip: If you are a famous person, don't respond to critics. Nothing good will result. You just come off as petty, narcissistic, vindictive, and uproariously insecure. This goes for all famous musicians, actors, celebrities, and Presidents.
As is customary in electronic music some people (let's call them Probspot) took the idea too far and before long a bastard trend emerged that focused on those bright, shiny, twinkle twinkle little star melodies that everyone liked in Xpander because people can't help themselves when it comes to bright, shiny, pretty things. This whole genre is like dangling a keychain in front of a raccoon.
Twinkle twinkle Little Prog ripped off the melody from Baa Baa Black Sheep and the Alphabet Song.
So naturally these pretty melodies won over clubland. Which is kind of a grievous betrayal when you think about it since Prog was created to stay away from cheesy bullshit in the first place. Granted, Prog gets lost up its own butthole pretty frequently but this isn't what it had in mind. How on Earth can a scene built to directly counter cheesy music effectively become cheesy itself? And all within a decade while the living memory of its ancient sound was still fresh?
Never underestimate the allure of commercial success. A lot of these artists made Prog for the street cred but they made Vocal Trance for the fuck-you money.
It didn't take long before they took to breeding the two genres giving birth to the hellspawn gouda dispensary known as: McProg.
The final insult.
Ish.


## McProg
*aka:  Vocal Prog, Melodic Prog* in the Progressive scene, emerged in early 00s

The actual name for this genre is Vocal Prog, but among Prog afficionados it's more commonly known as McProg (because they hate it), which is something that I somewhat invented or inspired to invent. Not the music, just the name. Let me explain.
I originally coined the pejorative "McTrance" to refer to the 1999 era of Eurotrance with the paint-by-numbers anthems, 96th-bar breakdowns, and 16-bar snare rolls as something so repetitive, so copycat, and so template-driven that the anthems cease to have any euphoric effect after steadily listening to it for nine months (your mileage may very but that's generally how long it takes to get absolutely tired of the same breakdowns, builds and anthems in every song in every mix).
McTrance is so cliched and boilerplate that it seems like every record is created by algorithms or run off an assembly line, like fast food. And like fast food it's something people do not value the inherent quality of but seek instantaneous and short-term sustenance. It is cheaply made, cheaply performed, and it is consumed like a pulp novel or morning coffee. I'm using the present tense because Eurotrance still sounds like this today.
Well, guess what: The same thing happened to Prog. Not as in "Prog is trying to sound like Eurotrance" but rather the commercialized process of boiling every interesting thing in the genre down to one or two concentrated stock flavors, and then everyone adds water and runs those stock flavors through the same mass-produced audio presets to create a bland soup made of thousands of tracks of the same-sounding music. This is audio gruel.
Enjoy your Prog, peasants.
I must give credit where credit is due: The Trancecrackers came up with this one. After coming to my way of thinking regarding Eurotrance they recognized the same superficial conformity was infecting Prog like some horrible mutant virus that cripples creativity and promotes tepid, trite vocal bollocks as the raison d'etre of the genre's existence.
This is safe and boring "club house" meant for inoffensive clothing stores, hotel lobbies, fabric softener commercials, Christian music festivals, and nursing homes. It's somber, cozy, idyllic, pastoral; it's so effervescent that it feels like parody music to the point where it transcends its own uplifting warmth to invert into something ironic and disturbing.
And it's all the same, each track a carbon copy of the others in form, style, and composition. McProg is to music what Thomas Kinkade is to art. Salvador Dali would have considered the entire genre of McProg a masterpiece of sentimental absurdism.
So of course it is the most popular genre because when the entirety of humankind is taken into account the median music listening palette is akin to fast food. The vast majority of people out there like crap and there's nothing we can do about it. They're not going to like Prog, but they're going to like this (or worse yet: The recent studio-invented abomination that is Tropical House -- the basic bitch of electronic music genres).
If you ever search for recent "Progressive House" mixes on Youtube, this is what you get: McProg. It's all McProg, all the way through, to the point where it might convince you that this is the only Prog that exists, or even that this is what Progressive House is. It's not. It's an offense to everything Prog is, was, or stands for.
You know how you look up Progressive House mixes on Youtube and you get some 2 hour video clip with a single image of a hot chick? .....Yeah, she doesn't know it's not Progressive House either.
But the scions of Prog were not done disappointing us. It still had another gimmick up its sleeve, in the form of... 8th Note.
Ish.


## 8th Note Prog
*aka:  McProg, dut dut dut dut dut dut dut dut* in the Progressive scene, emerged in late 00s

8th Note Prog is a joke that went too far.
It started off in 2006 with a typical McProg track with a very basic set of eighth notes (hence the name) and liberal use of envelopes, filters and detuned oscillators that made it sweep from a tight and closed "dit dit dit dit" to an open and washy "dat dat dat dat" but mostly it just sounds like "dut dut dut dut" which is one of its nicknames. I'm being very scientific here.
It was a huge success but it wasn't in any position to be influential or important in any way, except that a demo track of the song along with samples and loops of many of its key elements including the "dut dut dut dut" sound were included in the next release of the desktop music software FL Studio (formerly Fruityloops).
It used to be third rate music software but it has actually gotten pretty powerful over the years. It's still responsible for Souljia Boy, though. And that is unforgiveable.
Amateur musicians can't resist the allure of free samples and sample packs that do all the work for them so of course they rushed to make their own "dut dut dut dut" music.
At the same time, social media was blowing up and a new mp3 selling site called Beatport emerged, creating a perfect storm of cultural conversion and contamination that I like to call the "stupid zeitgeist". Because every stupid trend since then is driven by copycats flooding the market with substandard amateur Fruitytunes garbage since there is no quality control.
It suddenly became really easy to not only make 8th Note Prog, but to upload it, share it, and flood the market with it, and for a few years that's all we heard in the world of Prog. So this entire genre is a result of laziness, unqualified musicianship, and a bottlenecking of music trends toward one or two key sources.
Intellectually speaking 8th Note Prog is the worst sort of music that exists. It is made by downloading a pack and following a tutorial. There is no exploration or creativity here, there is no understanding what the settings do or who the music is for, it's all drag-and-drop samples, copy the step-by-step instructions and upload to the music store that everyone visits. It's a very stale way to make it big in the music industry.
(And it was a harbinger of things to come as the next logical step would naturally be the algorithm busting SEO marketing campaign known as The Chainsmokers. It's not music, it's Internet viral bullshit.)
Fortunately 8th Note Prog did not last long because such a genre is so limited in scope and originality that it couldn't possibly last and everyone was absolutely sick of it by 2010. This is the type of tepid shit that became royalty free music on YouTube at the time.
Progressive -- which had always styled itself as a scene that welcomes the employment of new sounds, textures, and ideas not conventionally found in House music -- has been reduced to a single sample and template/tutorial. It requires a form of doublethink to even qualify this as Progressive when it is the exact opposite. This is the ultimate nadir of this scene. Prog has officially reached rock bottom.
Thanks a lot, Joel.
Ish.



## Progressive
*aka:  Prog* in the Progressive scene, emerged in mid 90s

The word "progressive" is normally a descriptor of genres, an adjective like "hard", "deep", or "dark". The adjective "progressive" refers to a genre's attempt to forward itself into a new intellectual realm of musical curiosity (read: arty pretentiousness).
Lots of music scenes have a "progressive" version that extends the framework of their aesthetics, from Progressive Breaks to Progressive Trance and Progressive House, and even non-electronic music like Progressive Rock and Progressive Metal. These "progressive" genres have nothing in common with each other other than a drive to explore and expand the quality of their genre's native essence. At least, that's what they think they're doing.
Progressive Insurance is just like regular insurance except with meandering, noodly, 16 hour solos.
And then there's this -- an actual scene and genre called Progressive. Not Progressive anything, just Progressive, or Prog. A noun rather than an adjective.
It probably got its name as a fusion genre between Progressive House and Progressive Trance, producing something that simultaneously sounds like both and neither (but don't call it Trouse because that's just stupid. What kind of Dutch idiot would call it that?). Two Progressives = One Prog, if my math is correct.
So just to be clear, Progressive the noun (this stuff) has nothing to do with progressive the adjective (all the other stuff) even though Progressive the noun did come from a progressive the adjective genre, specifically Progressive House. But in doing so, it lost all pretense in the word "progressive" entirely. It's now just a meaningless label for this style of music with no relationship to the actual definition of progressive, like calling North Korea the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
With that said, at what point did Progressive House become just Prog? And then how did this subgenre become a scene onto itself? It didn't happen overnight. Progressive House has always been the potpourri of House music genres, utilizing instrumentation and sounds that were not traditionally used in House, from acoustic guitars to tamborines to ethnic wailing.
But a lot of Progressive House records had a "Dub mix" on the other side that was the same track but darker, thicker, deeper, not deeper as in Deep House, but moody and cold. You can plot a path that runs through several subtle tracks that slowly ease--okay, I see I'm losing you so I'll get to the point. It's all because of this mix:
Ironically the worst song is Digweed's own Heaven Scent, which is a Progressive Trance anthem that doesn't fit with the rest of the mix.
Before John Digweed's seminal Bedrock mix in 1999, the music was still considered Progressive House. After it seemed fit to divorce the dub-heavy Bedrock sound from Progressive House entirely and become a new thing called Progressive or Prog.
Championed by Sasha and Digweed, Prog became the absolute antidote to the late 90s disease affecting clubland known as anthemitis. Prog's popularity was fueled by a complete loathing for cheesy Dutch shite, which is ironic considering the descendents of Prog turned it into cheesy shite in their own right.
Prog was one of the first genres to be called "EDM" in the early 2000s when a lot of Sasha-worshipping Trance DJs made the shift to Prog and trancecrackers were unsure what to call what they were playing that was not Trance anymore. So blame them for the popularity of that stupid term.
Amazingly, Prog has retained the purity of its sound for nearly 20 years, probably out of disgust for what has been done to it. There is almost no other good music in this scene. It's all cheesy bollocks, and for a scene that started out trying to get away from cheesy bollocks, seeing what's happened to it is a betrayal more heartbreaking than Judas Iscariot, Marcus Brutus, Vidkun Quisling, Ephialtes, and Benedict Arnold combined.
Ish.


## Minimal Prog
*aka:  Minimal Progressive House, Minimal Progressive, Min Prog, Min P, Min, Mi, M* in the Progressive scene, emerged in mid 00s

Prog has always been a bassy, heavy, thick genre with lots of compression and stuff going on. On a spectrum analyzer it looks like a big fat bar -- very few peaks and valleys (not including long-ass breakdowns).
Minimal Prog is an attempt to do away with all that, and do for Prog what Minimal Tech did for Tech House and Minimal Techno did for Detroit Techno, which is kind of like looking with envy at another culture that likes to eat their own farts and thinking "My people should eat their own farts too!"
The hairs are split quite thin here since it seems over the years that proper Progressive and Tech House have almost merged, with Tech House getting thicker and Progressive getting simpler, which is exactly what either needed to do to sound like the other. At this point the differences are cosmetic (and territorial -- this is a UK vs Germany thing. Not like the UK and Germany haven't ever competed in something before).
With that said, this is a very important genre that matters a lot to some people -- the kind of people who host their own "TOP DJ" competitions and then fight over whether it should be Jamie Jones or  Ricardo Villalollolollolobos, which is like the fart-eaters arguing with the poo-sniffers over who has the better diet.
Speaking of Minimalism, here's minimal art. I don't know about you, but I see a graphic equalizer.
Nathan Fake and Border Community are largely responsible for pushing Prog in a direction that was more like Minimal Tech than anyone wants to admit. Because Minimal Tech was a thing, and Prog wanted to be a thing too.
Minimal Prog got its chance when Sasha and Digweed decided to make it a thing (just as they made Twinkle Prog a thing, and Progressive a thing and Progressive House a thing before that -- see a pattern here?).
When it comes to pure influential power, there are few artists in electronic music who can control the musical narrative as well as them. This only applies up to about 2008 or so, however. The whole scene has gone off the rails since then and Sash & Diggers want nothing to do with the monstrosity it has become. They have turned away from it in much the same way Adam Sandler has turned away from being funny.
If Minimal Prog is still around it's probably confused for Minimal Tech or Deeptech. Or even Twinkle Prog. To tell the difference: Listen for the breakdowns. Prog is all about the massive 2+ minute breakdowns but usually no build or anthem. Tech House genres don't have big breakdowns (note: May no longer be true after 2013, or whenever Dirtybird started doing dumb shit).
Ish.

# Tech House

## Deeptech
*aka:  Deep Tech, Deep-tech, Urban House, Deep Tech House, Underground House* in the Tech House scene, emerged in early 00s

Ah, Deeptech: The most maligned genre in electronic music.
A genre that probably existed much longer than people think, Deeptech (not to be confused with Deep Tech, an IT term to describe tech startups engaged in risky or experimental technologies) lingered as a Tech House subgenre for about a decade before coming to prominance in the 2010s. But what is it exactly? The answer might be very difficult, like playing darts with cooked spaghetti.
As succinct as I can put it, Deeptech is Tech House's attempt to sound like Deep House but failing miserably. But that's okay -- It is a UK genre and it's a running theme among UK genres to try to emulate non-UK genres, not quite succeeding at it, but still coming up with something interesting nonetheless.
It is mostly spearheaded by Crosstown Rebels and Hot Creations, and I say that only because if I don't RA readers will whine -- like a Kardashian on Instagram after being refused backstage at Coachella -- that I don't mention their precious #1 DJs more.
Look: If you want deep soulful grooves in your House music, there is a whole bloody scene of Deep House for that (or failing that, even Progressive would do). There is more to deep music than just a solid state bassline (with maybe some dubby reverb) at a lower tempo.
With that said, Deeptech is quite nice to listen to and is probably the most interesting of the Tech House genres. The one good thing you can say about it is that unlike the rest of Tech House its basslines aren't monotonous. But mostly it just sounds like you're watching a long turd come out of a dog.
So I have a love/hate relationship with Deeptech (like most Tech House). Yes, it's deep. But it's not deep the way Deep House is deep, or like how Deep/Dub Techno is deep, or even like how Prog is deep. It's a UK variant so it has elements of UK music in it -- Speed Garage, Grime, even Afrobeat/UK Funky. Only deep, but without the soul found in House. I told you this was going to be difficult.
I suppose it is necessary to explain what, exactly, is meant by deep music, but unfortunately there isn't one. Like funk or pornography, there is no agreed upon definition -- you just know it when you hear it. Or maybe it's a relative thing, like size or weight. Any track can be considered deep when compared to something that's not so deep. But that doesn't work either because there are plenty of things that aren't deep but might be labeled deep in comparison. I'm rambling again.
You know who doesn't know what Deeptech is? Beatport! As demonstrated when they released their sales chart a few years back:
Is it a gradual appreciation of Deep House, or is Beatport mislabeling way too much crap as Deep House? YOU DECIDE!Also: lol Dubstep
This is why you should never rely on music stores to categorize your music for you. Half the time they get it wrong, and the other half it's just to increase sales. This also applies to compilations and mix CDs. They're labelled for marketing, not accuracy. And also algorithms: Never let a chunk of data mining code curate your playlists for you because they're not going to tell you what is proper deep music any more than humans can.
I don't blame you for not being able to recognize the difference right off the bat. It's a lot like wine snobbery -- you won't be able to tell after just one taste. But keep drinking because the genre is worth it.
Just remember: This is Deeptech. Not Deep House. Listen, and learn the difference.
Ish.


## Fidget House
*aka:  Scratchy Electrohouse* in the Tech House scene, emerged in late 90s technically, mid 00s properly

No, this is not a distraction genre for attention deficit children. Well, it might.
Fidget House is one of the most unintentionally accidental genres in electronic music. Yet despite being a complete mistake, it somehow has the greatest tracks:hits ratio -- that is, it has a disproportionate number of monster tracks occupying a very small and undedicated genre.
Fidget House is almost small enough to be a micro-genre. There are no dedicated labels or artists producing it exclusively. The number of Fidget House tracks that actually exist are sparse and infrequent, and usually get mislabeled as Electrohouse. But the number of Fidget House tracks that have crushed record charts and changed pop music forever is ridiculous. Let me explain:
It all started with a dodgy throwaway number in 1999: Mr. Oizo - Flat Beat, which went viral thanks to a pre-Youtube video of a muppet going full Night-At-the-Roxbury to its now-infamous LFO wubby bassline:

It was even used to sell Levis jeans
	

(or quite possibly a year earlier with M-seq but it's not the track that went viral)
Fidget House had arrived! But not really because no one did anything with the sound for almost a whole decade. It did not have a name and its only track was sorted into the proto-Electrohouse bin. Because one weird track does not make a genre despite what clickbait tells you (producers hate it!).
Flash forward to the mid 2000s and all of a sudden that LFO bassline is super popular thanks to Dubstep and Ketamine. The man most responsible for this is David James Andrew Taylor aka Solid Groove, who adopted a new pseudonym Switch to make music of the wubby Dubstep style for his label Dubsided which was already making dubby Tech House anyway (redundant I know but stay with me here).
Taking the Electrohouse blueprint and glitching it up more than it already is glitched up -- with scratchy acid, LFO basslines and Rave-style anthems -- Switch and his buddy Jesse Rose jokingly called what they were doing "fidget house". Probably because it sounds like an impatient child who can't sit through a 3-minute song without skipping ahead to see what comes next. In fact, I think that's how most people listen to music nowadays.
In their own words, Fidget House is "...a joke, which has now gone a little too far." Well joke's on them. Normally one label and one mega hit track and a couple producers caning ADHD House isn't enough to warrant inclusion on this guide, except something caught on and before you know it we have the Crookers remix of King Cudi - Day 'N' Nite ripping up dance charts, a song I only became aware of from a neighbour in 2010 who played this song every night. Nothing a little Techmaster PEB response music can't fix.
As if to one-up itself as the little genre that could, two years later Fidget House blessed its sound technique on the scions of Berry Gordy's Motown empire (must be nice to make it in the music business due to nepotism) and armed with a massive budget and commercial marketing, everybody be shufflin' which, compared with earlier dance styles, is half-ripoff and half-awful. And Millenials are terrible dancers.
This is the face that Millenials give you when you're not "with it".
Okay, so Fidget House hit the lottery. Thrice. What an amazing fluke.
And then two years later this happened:
This is the face of 3 billion views on Youtube.
In less than a month, a Korean prank artist (and Koreans aren't exactly known for their sense of humor) rose from somewhat locally appreciated but globally obscure origins to become the official theme music/dance number of cheerleader & marching band half time shows at American high school football games.
No other genre can claim that level of complete and total pop culture saturation. And the funny thing is despite all these one-hit wonders, there was never enough interest in Fidget House to make more of it. It never dominated dancefloors or record pools the way Eurotrance or French House did. Probably because most Fidget House is just not that interesting to begin with (a running theme in Tech House). But hey, when it sees a big juicy hit hovering over the plate, it knocks it out of the park.
Just don't expect any followups or copycats.
Ish.


## Tech House
*aka:  Techno House, House Techno* in the Tech House scene, emerged in mid 90s

Tech House is the Jazz Funk of electronic music.

From The Mighty Boosh. They're wrong about Funk, but they're right about Jazz, and they're very right about Jazz Funk. I'm ambivalent about Gary Numan.
	

(note: Jazz Funk, which totally sucks ass, is not to be confused with Funk Jazz, which is totally awesome)
Somehow by incorporating the strengths of both Techno and House, Tech House succeeded in appealing to neither. So the result is something frustratingly banal and monotonous when it really shouldn't be.
Tech House is House with Techno influences, as opposed to Techno House, which is Techno with House influences and as far as I know was a short-lived niche thing in the 80s that never left the confines of Detroit so it's not here.
Tech House straddles the razor-thin tightrope of something that doesn't have enough funky warmth for House yet not enough cold mechanicalism for Techno, so what comes out instead is something stiff, repetitive, and boring. It's such a disappointment, like the last season of Game of Thrones.
Tech House had real promise. It could have done great things with the tools it had. And it's something everyone hoped would happen, like feeding Scrabble tiles to a dog to see if it shits out a word. But instead Tech House wasted its potential on pretentious Berlin nightclubs and that aimless, meandering noodlyness that the Brits are fond of, like a 70s prog rock solo that goes on for way too long. Technically interesting but utterly soulless.
That's not to say Tech House didn't bring anything new to the table. If it has one distinctive feature to listen for that you can go "ah yes, this is Tech House", it's the off beat open hi-hats. They exist in House too but in Tech House they're bright and prominent, and after awhile your apophenia takes over and you start hearing rhythms in them, a sort of "CHIK-A-CHIK" shuffle rhythm that's not actually there. Try it. It's pretty wild.
Tech House can be good. There is honestly good Tech House out there. I've even heard some. But finding it is a Herculian task of Sisyphian anguish in a Kafka-esque, Orwellian realm of Dostoevskian torment. It is possible to load up your music player with nothing but Tech House mixes, hop into your car, and drive to the other end of the continent and back and never hear the same song twice yet never hear an interesting song once. The odds of coming across decent Tech House are worse than needles made of diamonds in a rough full of haystacks.
If there is any hope left for Tech House, it lies with Dirty Bird.Justin Martin once stepped on my foot while we were dancing at a party. If you see him, kick him in the nads for me.
Tech House probably has its origins in Detroit which made it briefly interesting until it found a better home overseas in the UK (and then later on Germany), and like all imported genres the UK variant is invariably less interesting and often stripped of much emotion.
The people who are into Tech House like to pretend they are hip, cultured and refined, but all that means is they have more expensive yet less interesting tastes. It's like going to a gourmet restaurant and getting two parsely leaves and a tomato slice adorned with orangey-red splotches around the edge of your plate. And a dash of paprika. For $50. Even the songs sound half finished, half baked and half thought through. Tech House is ripoff music.
Tech House has charted an interesting evolution over the years, as shown in this graph:
See, these writeups are backed by a lot of science and data. I don't just make shit up.
As you can see, like an inverse geometric progression, Tech House is slowly and steadily becoming more mediocre as time goes on, yet at the same time it's becoming more popular. At some point in the 2000s the lines intersected, and its popularity has outpaced its quality ever since. I blame Resident Advisor.
Resident Advisor is only the second most popular electronic music community on the Internet because they cover both kinds of electronic music: Progressive and Tech House. Their most popular feature was the RA readers annual DJ poll, set up as a counter poll to that other one that they felt didn't faithfully represent the music they liked. And you know it's an honest, unbiased poll because Tech House DJs have won it nine times in the nine years of its existence, and fifteen times if you count the other six times they won it.
The RA poll was discontinued in 2017 out of fear that Dixon would win it for a fifth straight year because RA readers are stupid myopic lemmings just as much as DJ Mag readers.
RA was also a pioneer in the "indecipherable font as a logo" industry long before Millenial DJs.
Due to its popularity, Tech House split off into a number of subgenres in the 00s that are even more insidiously insipid. At this current rate I expect Tech House to be nothing more than a kick and a snare with open hi-hats 10 years from now. And music dork magazines will call it the most innovative and forward-thinking music ever. Like Jazz Funk.
If one good thing can be said for Tech House, it's that it has no stomach for the breakdown-build-anthem nonsense that infests so many other genres, especially these days. However, that doesn't mean it's not trying for Eurotrance/No Skool Breaks/Jumpup/Dubstep/Anthem House style anthems and drops (looking at you, Dirty Bird). It just needs to figure out how to do it discreetly. Because god forbid Tech House would ever want to do anything interesting.
Ish.


## Microhouse
*aka:  Minimal House, Glitch House* in the Tech House scene, emerged in late 90s

You know how sometimes you download (and by download I mean purchase legitimately from an online music store) a totally legal mp3 (from a completely authorized source that sells music downloads approved by the artists and the recording industry in a legit and secure manner and is not involved in piracy at all), but the music has little hiccups and twerping noises in it?
Those are called artifacts -- little audio errors that occurred in the mp3 digital encoding process. They're the audio equivalent of compression artifacts in low quality Photoshopped images.
Akufen -- for when you feel Resident Advisor's DJ poll is not pretentious enough.
Artifacts were quite common back in the 90s when mp3s (that everyone purchased legally from licensed sources approved by the RIAA) proliferated as low quality 128 kbps audio files because file size was an issue back then.
Sometimes it was difficult to find a good mp3 of a song (that you are allowed to own a digital copy of because you have the original CD) that didn't have any artifacts. Nobody liked artifacts and it was a rough period where procuring quality music (through completely valid and legitimate channels that you totally pay for honestly) was difficult. Such are the perils of (purchasing completely legal) music (via honest means that you are allowed to own and do not steal, copy or pirate in any way) back in the day.
Of course that didn't stop some dumbass from thinking that maybe mp3 artifacts can be harnessed into a new style of music the same way a creative person looks at garbage and tries to make it art. And that's why we have Microhouse.
It's like an auto company coming up with a new type of car with a special engine that rattles all the time, the steering wheel shudders at high speed, and the muffler is hanging low and dragging on the ground. Those aren't bugs, they're features!
Could have used more artifacts.
A lot of genres are based on mistakes (happy accidents according to one B. Ross). Microhouse is the only genre based on an actual error.
Before long this gave producers the idea to "glitch" up their productions with slices of samples instead of full bar samples, some of them slivered down to 1/64th notes which sounds like someone channel surfing annoyingly fast or constantly cranking the radio dial in their car.
The microscopic slicing of samples is where the genre gets its name, first coined by Philip Sherburne in a 2001 article that no one has ever read because why would anyone want to read about music like this? It also doesn't hurt that the music is sparse and isolated, with tight and punchy percussion and light on pads and leads. Only one place on Earth would want to make such music: Detroit.
Microhouse arrived at the perfect time, when IDM was blowing up and people were finally started to warm up to the clicks and cuts oddity of the experimental Glitch crowd. All you need to do is attach a steady beat and a rhythmic cadence to those random and arhythmic slices and they would totally work as a dance genre.
Chalk it up to Detroit for giving us another bare-bones genre to stroke our chins to, but the genre left the confines of the American Midwest soon afterward and found a captive audience in Detroit's sister culture: Germany. There it evolved into the pinnacle of dancefloor zombification: Minimal Tech.
Past this point, nothing remains except the plinky plonk.
Ish.


## Minimal Tech
*aka:  Plinky Plonk, Berliner School, Minimal Tech House, Minimal, mnml, m* in the Tech House scene, emerged in early 00s

If you thought Tech House was already uninteresting as a concept and Microhouse the absolute extent of the creativity of that uninterestingness, well good news: Here comes Minimal Tech, the genre so uninteresting I simply call it "plinky plonk". Because it sounds like an array of penny slots at a Vegas casino vomiting marbles into a tub of vaseline when they hit jackpot.
Minimal Tech is not to be confused with Minimal Techno, which was mostly a mid 90s Detroit thing. Nor is it to be confused with Microhouse, which was a late 90s Detroit thing that later on became a 00s Germany thing (it's complicated).
Minimal Tech is a full-on German thing that is so German Richie Hawtin had to move to Germany to make it (and he called his new label M_nus, because his previous label was Plus 8 (get it?), and when you feel like you want to go in a different direction, it's important to take your established greatness and subtract what made it so great.
He also substracted baldness from his head.
Microhouse at least had a gimmick with its micro-slicing of samples and glitch cuts. I guess Minimal Tech considered that too esoteric so out goes the glitchy samples.
It also removed the funky basslines, replacing them with basic two tone monotonous nonsense (this is what happens when your genre is made entirely by white people). The sparse pads and leads are also gone, replaced by... whatever those bleeps and bloops are trying to do. It's like they're trying to eke out a melody but they're too lazy to even try, like hiring a kid to paint your fence but he only does one side and it's only one coat of paint. And he wants $120 for that?
And then there's Samim - Heater, Minimal Tech's most popular track and consequently its most interesting one, probably because it has an actual lead melody delivered via accordian of all things.

And this is the radio mix. The 12" mix goes on like this for 13 minutes.
	

Of course the chin-stroking denizens of the genre hated it when it came out because it was fun and silly and had immense cross-over appeal, not like the pretentious elitist music they crave.
Minimal Tech very much has the look, feel and maturity of wind down music for ravers in their 40s who have long-since discontinued the practice of getting totally thrashed like they did back in the 90s. They restrict themselves to partying in penthouses/rooftops, swanky lofts, and yachts.
Our music choices mellow out as we age. Yours will too if it hasn't happened already and you're not one of those types who is always living in the past with the radio dial stuck on the classic rock station and insisting to anyone within earshot that music peaked in 1974 aka the year you first got laid.
But if you don't keep moving forward you doom yourself into becoming a Jerry listening to Human Music. That's a warning you Tech House cretins: Don't be a Jerry.

If you want a vision of the future, imagine a generation of Jerrys listening to Minimal Tech Human Music.... forever.
	

So of course this stuff is massively popular and it influenced other scenes a lot including IDM, Drum n Bass, Techno, House, and UK Garage. In all honesty the odd Minimal Tech song every so often is quite alright because it makes good transition music between peaks and valleys in DJ sets.
But enduring an entire set (or worse yet, an entire night) of just this music is like Stephen King's The Jaunt: It turns life into meaningless eternity.
Ish.

# House

## UK House
*aka:  Brit House* in the House scene, emerged in late 80s

A word on regionally-derived genre names: Not all of the music needs to come from there. In fact, after the first year or so, if it's successful enough to wrap around the world then it's free from geographic restrictions.
Anyone from anywhere can make any music they like. You don't have to be from Chicago to make Chicago House or from Italy to make Italo House. That's just where the music got its start. Some of the best French House artists and labels aren't even French (they may be Quebecois, which the French may take offense but for entirely different reasons).
The one exception to this is Detroit Techno, which is specifically defined as Techno that only comes from Detroit and nowhere else. Because not even Detroit Techno considers Detroit Techno to be real Detroit Techno.
With that said: This is UK House, the somewhat obscure and short-lived but in no way less brilliant overseas companion to Chicago House. Because importing records from Chicago every week to fuel their all-night rave orgies was super expensive so to cut costs the limeys thought "how hard could it be?" And gave it a go.
What came out was something that sounded Housey and Balearic and slightly Stock-Aitken-Waterman because everything sounded Stock-Aitken-Waterman in the UK in the 80s. They were absolutely insufferable.
Yeah -- these assholes right here.
Much like they had done with Bleep Techno, British artists had completely failed at whatever they were trying to emulate but what they created instead was fascinating nonetheless. It was an interesting blend of ethnic Mediterranean vibes, pop hooks, and Chicago instrumentation (again, sans 808s -- I don't know why but they seldom used the 808) to create something that was extremely useful at the time and extremely influential later on when it would morph into Progressive House.
UK House artists introduced things that the Chicago dudes hadn't thought of, probably as a result of the strong Balearic influence accompanying returning vacationers. Things like tribal percussion, ethnic chants and wailing, panflutes, tamborines and maracas and shakers, and anything that captures the bliss of dancing naked on a Mediterranean beach while the sun sets as opposed to sweating the night away in a dingy gay Chicago club.
Like the punters care.
Despite being a "stepping stone" genre, UK House is more influential than anyone realizes. When it was exported to the mainland it became Eurohouse, when it decided there were no rules anymore in House music it became Progressive House, and when it composed itself and showed a little focus it became Tech House.
You have to admire a genre for that kind of foresight, even if no one really remembers it anymore and its sound was never that cohesive to begin with.
Ish.


## Eurohouse
*aka:  Future House* in the House scene, emerged in early 90s

Eurohouse was a sister genre to Italo House, at least initially.
At first it didn't have any specific unifying sound or technique and was generally defined as any House music coming out of mainland Europe that didn't fit anywhere else. It was mostly produced with the same Korg M1 synthesizer that delivered all those lovely piano lines (the Korg M1 dominated everything in the late 80s. Together with the Roland D-50 and the Yamaha DX7 they make up the Great Triumvirate of 80s synthesizers).
Around 1992, however, Eurohouse producers discovered another setting on the Korg M1 called "Organ2" which sounds nothing like a real organ but that doesn't matter because a real organ is probably not what they were looking for anyway. Possibly because of Nightcrawlers - Push The Feeling On (or Jenny Bee - Wanna Get Your Love or Robin S - Show Me Love) the organ became a common component of Eurohouse. 100 patches on the M1 and everyone uses the same one because music producers are lemmings.

I think it was these guys' fault.
	

In musical notation it became known as the "doot" sound. That's the official scientific term for it, not to be confused with the pizzicato anthem "doot" sound that dominated mid 90s Anthem House care of Faithless, Sash!, DJ Quicksilver and the like. This is about the Eurohouse "doot" sound. And not to be confused with other sounds that exist in the Universe that people have called "doot".
The secret is to play everything in the lower register to give it a low, flat, bassy sound compared with what one would normally associate with an organ pitch-wise. That makes it sound closer to a woodwind, like a punchy panflute or something. If that's even possible. I guess with the proper envelope anything is possib-I'm rambling.
Eurohouse gave UK producers a lot of ideas that they took and incorporated, giving rise to Progressive House. That could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how snarky I'm feeling that day.
And don't think this sound has gone away because Katy Perry just resurrected it (with the doot and everything) and performed it on Saturday Night Live which might not have been a very noteworthy event if not for Backpack Boy -- the Fred Astaire of flossing.

Flossing was 2018's dabbing. If you're still doing this dance in 2019, go kill yourself on Fortnite.
	

It's okay for mainstream artists to pilfer the past and/or underground like that, just don't call it something new or original or pretend like you invented it. Pop doesn't invent shit -- it waits for the underground to make it a thing first. Even if it made it a thing 25 years ago.
Eurohouse has seen a recent resurgence under the nebulous monicker Future House (might call it a subgenre, but I really wouldn't because what did they do with it, really? Take the Korg M1 organ and make it raspy?). And with Katy Perry's help (and probably Oliver Heldens), it will probably be around for awhile longer. Because music producers are lemmings.
Ish.


## World House
*aka:  Latin House, Tribal House, Salsa House, Samba House, Soca House, Basso Nova House, Ska House, Afrobeat, UK Funky* in the House scene, emerged in late 80s

World House is not really a genre.
Like Themed Rap, this is a collection of genres grouped together because House is a massive global scene with hundreds of topical genres, subgenres, regional genres, and language/country specific genres. Someday I want to expand this section but I don't plan on doing anything about it right now.
Pulling the bulk of the weight here are the Latin genres, including Salsa House, Conga House, Soca House, Bossa Nova House, Ska House, Shitty Ska House (aka Punk with a drum machine), whatever the Puerto Ricans living in the eastern seaboard are doing, and any form of House that pulls influences from the Spanish parts of the Americas including Central America, South America, Caribbean America, Spanish America, non-America America, and Iberia. But not Brazil because that's not Spanish, that's Portuguese (hey, if you can't tell the difference between Samba and Salsa music, I don't know what to do with you).
Some of these Latin genres like using the clave rhythm, used in Afro-Cuban music like Rumba, Conga, Salsa, Mambo, Songo, Timba, Dicka, Bonga, Dildo, Taco, etc. The clave rhythm can be played 3-2 or 2-3 which is difficult to explain in words so let me show you in drum machine notation.

Clave 3-2
Clave 2-3
Clave is 4/4 just like any other western music, but the off-beat cadence makes it sound hot and spicey. It can sometimes also be found in Reggaeton and Dancehall.
There are also nods to more ethnic genres like Tribal House, Afro House/Afrobeat, UK Funky, and Angolan Accordian Tapdancing House just in case it exists. There are an almost unlimited number of genres of House music, each one taking a particular culture's aesthetics and applying any one of countless musical techniques to it. So long as it has a steady beat it's all House. It probably shouldn't be, but this is the world we deserve, not the world we asked for. I mean, UK Funky is here. If any genre is responsible for Brexit...
World House is not to be confused with Worldbeat, which is an actual genre that borrows the same ethnic third world influences but in a far more insipid way. Like Paul Simon - Graceland but more offensive.
If you must demand a distinctive quality in World House that separates it from the rest of House music, look toward things like Spanish guitars, horns (especially anthemic horns, or even mariachi -- incidentally, if you ever want to prank someone, hire a mariachi band to follow them around for an entire day playing hero music. Especially when they leave the bathroom), and busy percussion of the conga variety that can't necessarily be slated into Reggaeton or Moombahton.
World House is not a genre, but if it were it would still be around unless South America and Africa were blown to smithereens in some kind of world war, which is crazy because why would anyone want to do that?
Ish.


## Electrohouse
*aka:  Electro House, Swedish House, Complextro* in the House scene, emerged in early 00s

All retro movements like to have a 20 year buffer period. It's what happens when a generation becomes adults and looks back with fondness at the stuff they enjoyed when they were children.
In the 70s there was nostalgia for the 50s, with Happy Days, Grease and Jim Steinman productions all capturing the zeitgeist. In the 80s there was nostalgia for the 60s, with Hollywood literally rewriting the Vietnam war as something America won or at least tied. In the 90s there was nostalgia for the 70s, with John Travolta returning to A-list status and streetwise grunge kids saying "you know, this disco music ain't so bad after all"... usually after watching Quentin Tarantino movies.
And then in the 2000s, we get this: Electrohouse. Nostalgia for the 80s (a period that we are still in because nobody wants to remember the 90s). Sort of.

Unfortunately the 90s ended up making the 50s look like the 40s.
	

Just to be clear: There are two variants of Electrohouse, both defined by their origins. This version, aptly named Electrohouse, came from French House producers who ran out of 70s Disco records to sample so they moved on to sampling 80s Synthpop instead. The other variant, Filthy Electrohouse, comes from Electroclash and has more in common with the sleazy glitz and glampunk of the Eurotrash scene. But DJs typically caned both so it wasn't a demarcation that existed at the time.
But everyone called it all Electro, which they probably shouldn't and you shouldn't either because there already is a genre called Electro and it has nothing to do with this.
Electrohouse is House with 80s aesthetics. I hesitate to call any of its aesthetics "electro" because it sounds nothing like real Electro. Doesn't even use vocoders, a TR-808 or the Numbers break. But it tries very hard to be 80s throwback music, utilizing FM synths (or VSTs emulating FM synths), buzzy basslines, and crunchy samples.
All the genres along this tree -- Italo, Disco, French, Electro -- love their funky basslines but none made them fatter, crunchier, and more prominant than Electrohouse.
Electrohouse started off, innocuously enough, as a French House subgenre taken up by a second generation of producers who weren't French. In fact, an alarming number of them were Swedish for some reason, to such an extent that people took to calling the new sound Swedish House. Eric Prydz was the first one and he was quickly followed by Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso.
(Alesso and Avicii came later. They were not part of this first wave and they never actually made any Swedish House.... or anything particularly good for that matter).
The Swedes introduced the concept of the "farting bassline" to House music (something probably borrowed from G-Funk), the lo-fi saw wave that sounds like Kim Kardashian on an all beans diet with impeccable flatulence control.
The Swedes frequently remixed and guest-starred on each other's tracks and for a number of years the charts were dominated by the same group of guys so people took to calling them the Swedish House Mafia. It was probably a pejorative term initially but they didn't care and they liked the marketing.
Later in the decade Axwell, Ingrosso and Angello got together and formed an actual group called the Swedish House Mafia that ironically did not make any Swedish House but shitty Anthem House instead.
The Swedish House Mafia is a dingleberry clinging to the ass hair of electronic music. Seriously, what sort of horrendous ear sandpaper like One needs three god damn producers? What is it, exactly, that they each contributed to the track?
And Steve Angello's head is so far up his own ass he's eating yesterday's lunch.
Meanwhile, Swedish House gradually evolved into Electrohouse and over the decade kept evolving, employing less French things and more Electro things including scratchy acid, glitch cuts and stutter edits on samples, aggressive in-your-face anthems, and eventually Brostep yawns and belches.


An Electrohouse mix that tries to cover all the bases of this sordid scene.
	

Electrohouse is still around today although people don't like calling it Electrohouse anymore. It partners with Glitch Hop a lot, convincing people to call it Glitch House. And some sources have a burning desire to call it something else. Don't listen to them.
Ish.


## French House
*aka:  Filter House, Sidechain House, Tekfunk* in the House scene, emerged in late 90s

Disco House established the template of looping an old hook from a 70s song.
French House took it one step further and introduced the ridiculously addictive low-pass filter, a time-honored audio technique that kills higher frequencies making the signal sound muted, bassy, and when paired with flange and frequency sweeps, downright funky.
The filter was applied to everything, even the drum kick which made it go from a "Thump" to a soft "Doof", like punching a pillow. Also sidechaining, but I'll get to that later. The filter is so important to the aesthetics of French House that its pet name is "Filter House".
It's tempting to say that Daft Punk came up with French House's signature filter sound, but if you ask Thomas and Guy-Manuel, they'll probably tell you that they got it from Carl Craig (unless it was Motorbass) and DJ Sneak and very likely all the other names on Teachers, so this genre's origins are more of a merging of Tech House and Disco House. An early name for it was Tekfunk.
Daft Punk - Homework -- one single album that defined House music for the next decade.
French House took Disco loops and made them, well, loopier. Sliced full bars into half bars and quarter bars (and sometimes even eighth bars) and looped them with brashness and charm. By far the most repetitive House genre, French House eschews the AAAB stanza in favor of straight ahead no deviation AAAA madness -- a single looping bar with carefully crafted EQ filters bringing elements in and out, making it closer to its Tech House and Techno antecedents.
Of course with so many low-pass filters on everything, problems emerged. It's a fact of audio physics that if you play two sounds of the same frequency 180 degrees out of phase, they cancel each other out so the output is muted or extremely quiet. So with everything occupying the lower register, where is the kick drum to go? It gets drowned out by the other lower frequencies. The solution is sidechaining.
Sidechaining comes from an old radio technique called ducking, which allows DJs to talk over music without being drowned out by it. Whenever the DJ speaks, the music immediately dips in volume below the volume of his voice, so he can be heard more clearly. Ducking is useful for voiceovers, overdubbing, and all sorts of audio applications.
Sidechaining is the same thing, only used more microscopically: It drops the volume of everything playing at the same frequency as the drum kick, so that the kick can be heard while everything else ducks beneath it. This produces a curious, almost reverse-sounding effect in the pads and bass which, together with the kick, makes a sound that goes "WOMP WOMP WOMP WOMP" as they are constantly dropping their volume on every kick for just a fraction of a second, adding a new dimension of chunky French goodness.
You're probably bored by all this and don't care how the music is made. And I haven't even gotten into compression yet (and I won't, at least not here). Point is French House is really funky and there are a lot of fun audio techniques that make it funky.
Yes, Daft Punk essentially invented it with their Homework album, but they haven't made any French House since 2001, and individually Thomas hasn't made any French House since 2007 and Guy-Manuel maybe 2004? That's about the same time their labels (Roule and Crydamoure) stopped releasing stuff but that's okay. The French still dominate French House, but like other regional genres that go global, some of the best French House doesn't come from France.

The freshest, funkiest, Frenchiest House mix you'll ever listen to.
	

French House traced the careers of Daft Punk, conquering the world when they were making it and dying down when they stopped making it. After Homework everyone rushed to make the Daft Punk sound (even Madonna), and after 2001's Discovery everyone started getting a little tired of the "sample and filter the ever-living fuck out of an old 70s hook" technique (including Daft Punk which is why their next album -- 2005's Human After All -- didn't have any samples at all save for Robot Rock), which is about right.

The peak period for any popular genre is 3-5 years, and then everyone wants to move on to the big thing, which in this case was Electrohouse.
French House is still around because anything this addictively funky will never die. Just like Disco.
Ish.


## Disco House
*aka:  Funky House, Disco* in the House scene, emerged in early 90s

Disco House is House music with Disco.
Not a lot of Disco, usually just a short sample or phrase, enough to fit in one bar and then loop endlessly. House music was already post-Disco anyway, so Disco House is simply putting the horns, strings and walking basslines back in (often the original horns, strings, and walking basslines from the original Disco songs).
Disco House marked the beginning of a new age in House music in the wake of the great copyright crackdown on sampled music. House had always liberally borrowed samples from anywhere and everywhere, to such an extent it seemed like it was competing with Hip Hop on just how many 70s artists it could fit into one song (in some cases even building a track entirely out of samples). 
Chicago House, Italo House, New Beat, Hip House, and Disco House all pilfered the past for anything they wanted from looping grooves to James Brown grunts (or James Brown grunts as looping grooves).
This all stopped when the music industry started giving a shit and the copyright infringement lawsuits piled up. An army of lawyers lording over creative expression made prolific sampling prohibitively expensive, crushing it utterly (well, at least commercially. But Sample/Collage music should never be commercial anyway. It's art, not a product).
The new game was to clear your samples with the original artists: Either ask for their permission, pay them to use it (what usually happens) or let them share in the royalties. For many 70s bands who hadn't had a hit in decades this was a newfound income stream so they almost never refused and the price was modest.
But it put a damper on budget-conscious House producers who couldn't afford to clear dozens of samples on every track they made so over time House production simplified to just one sample or two per track (same thing happened in Rap).
Since copyright law doesn't distinguish between length or purpose (a micro-sliced sample of a drum hit is just as infringing as an entire chorus), by the mid 90s House music had trimmed itself down, shedding the one-off vocal shouts and 4th bar fills and random sound effects and colorful background clutter that permeated second generation (read: non-Chicago) House records.
Everything smoothed out into this: A single sampled hook from a Disco hit (or R&B, or Soul, or Funk, or Quiet Storm/Northern Soul, or a pop song from the 80s), looping and standing out as the track's centerpiece. Nothing else matters. The Disco sample is what you're listening for. Over and over and over again.
That doesn't make the genre bad or disagreeable in any way. Quite the contrary, Disco House is the most fun you will ever have listening to House music.

Listen to Disco, Disco House, House with Disco, Disco with House, and House and Disco with a side of Disco.
	

Apparently the Disco House writeup in my previous guide became a meme of sorts so let me just re-affirm what I said before:
Disco House has more fun than any other genre of music. If there was an official gauge of how much fun something is, Disco House would score off the chart. If there was a country in the world called Funia, Disco House would be its national anthem as well as the name of its capital city. In the land of Disco House everyone is free, cool, super and gay (that's gay as in happy and fun, not gay as in lame and stupid).
I was once walking down the street late one night and a sexual services entrepreneur called to me from the curb, inquiring if I was looking for some fun.
"No thanks, Miss," I replied, pulling out a pair of headphones. "I've got Disco House, the most fun there is." She nodded completely in agreement. "Word. Be on your way, then."
Ish.


## Italo House
*aka:  Gospel House, Diva House, Italo Dance* in the House scene, emerged in late 80s

While the Belgians were making rappy rap House, the Italians were making pianoey piano House.
Italo House was the second enormously popular House genre, breaking out with the hit Black Box - Ride On Time and probably peaking with Right Said Fred - I'm Too Sexy two years later.
Pianos and House go together like cheese curds and beef gravy. Chicago may have invented the rambly piano fill but the Italians made it art.
Not real pianos, of course. No one is using real instruments here. What made this sudden explosion of "piano" electronic music possible (Oldskool Rave Hardcore, UK House, Happy Hardcore, Progressive House, Balearic/Dream Trance, Anthem House, and Eurohouse were all caning piano fills in the early 90s) was the Korg M1 synthesizer.
What a Korg M1 might look like.
Released in 1988, the Korg M1 was the first synthesizer to reproduce realistic acoustic piano sounds that didn't sound like some tinny digital synthetic buzzy FM waveform DX7 crap. The secret was using actual rich samples of acoustic instruments rather than digital reproductions of them. It's like putting real cane sugar in your cola instead of that fake, filmy, high fructose corn syrup crap. Mexico still uses real sugar, by the way. Never pass up the chance to try Mexican coke. It is amazing. Their soda ain't so bad either.
Italo House had the perfect recipe for commercial success: Catchy hooks, that delicious 909 kick, Korg M1-driven uplifting piano lines, and of course bellowing divas (either hiring their own or sampling Loleatta Holloway - Love Sensation).
Not just any bellowing divas but over-the-top, in-your-face, finger wagging, head shaking, sassy black Aretha Franklin reaching-up-to-Heaven can-you-feel-tha-LORD gospel divas -- the kind that speak of gay empowerment and fashion fierceness as a religious awakening. It's such a powerful and evocative message of self-empowerment that a subgenre emerged called Gospel/Diva House that focused exclusively on the melodramatic vocal heroics of Soul divas. Most Italo House today is Gospel House.
Italo House was so massive that even Madonna made an Italo House track with Vogue, and that's not the first time she appropriated a gay underground fad. This is actually her modus operandi: She probes the (usually gay) underground for new music ideas, exploits it, and sells a cheap, shallow pop version of it to the masses for commercial digestion. She did the same thing to the kink/fetish scene for Erotica (producer: Shep Pettibone), the Eurotrance scene for Ray of Light (producer: William Orbit), the French House scene for Music (producer: Mirwais), and the Electrohouse scene for Confessions on a Dancefloor.
Producer: Stuart Price.
Madonna's formula is so well-known that other artists have copied it including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears. The mainstream is usually five years behind whatever is popular in the underground but these are the artists who like to get the jump on everyone else with their bland milquetoast sanitized contributions. But I digress.
Italy is famous for its exploitative entertainment (Italian exploitation films are best exploitation films) so when one track gets hot the copycats are out within weeks and that's how a genre becomes a genre. Because if the music doesn't all sound the same, how can we group it into categories and then bitch about it?

Listen to a fuckton of scrambly piano lines and over-the-top divas. What more could you ask for?
	

The classic Italo House sound is not around anymore (that I'm aware of). Its producers went on to make Eurodance, Eurohouse, Garage, and Disco House when the pianos got played out (they were retired around 1995 or so).

But Gospel House will always exist because everyone loves a sassy black woman pointing her finger and wagging her head and singing right to your face that she may be poor but she still has her pride and no one can ever take that away from her.
Testify, soul sister.
Ish.


## Hip House
*aka:  Techno Dance* in the House scene, emerged in late 80s

Hip House is House music with rapping. It happened pretty quickly after House music wrapped around the world because you'd have to be pretty dumb to not think of an idea like this.
Hip House was the first enormously popular House genre and the successors of Hip House -- including Italo House and Eurodance under the umbrella of "techno" dance music -- took it to a level of commercial affluence that the original Hip House artists still feel slightly cheesed about. Because none of the success went to the Chicago originators, but rather their Belgian (and to a lesser extent German...okay, and The KLF too) copycats. This is yet another example of success never going to the inventor, but to the exploiter of the invention.
It is customary in electronic music -- more of a Cassandrian curse -- for producers and DJs to either never find success in their hometowns, or for the genres they create to never catch on beyond their home cities.
Hip House is one of those genres that despite being made, controlled, produced, distributed and disseminated by the same Chicago House mavens that invented the whole scene.... they never got their due.
Instead, like all things coming out of Detroit and Chicago in the late 80s, Hip House found a captive audience overseas (specifically Belgium) who decided to make their own homebrewed brand of Hip House, and when that happened it was all over. Chicago completely cut off from all royalties or recognition.
To further aggravate the injustice a lot of European electronic music acts were "fake" in that the artists and performers were separate people. For instance, Technotronic originally used fashion model Felly Kalingi as its frontman in music videos and promo material despite the fact that she had nothing to do with the music. After the Milli Vanilli incident they dropped her and used the original recording artist Ya Kid K who was just as attractive, making the marketing choice to use a model a high risk zero benefit kind of one.
That's why everyone today still remembers Snap! and Technotronic and C+C Music Factory (and not just because they're still in regular rotation at NBA basketball games) and no one remembers Tyree or Doug Lazy (unless you were into the Chicago underground in those days).

And then by the 90s you have Technotronic -- thankfully with Ya Kid K -- performing Hip House on Arsenio Hall. Somewhere Tyree Cooper is hurling things at people.
	

If you got into this side of "techno" in the early 90s, let it be known that you weren't actually listening to Techno. It was more or less either Hip House or Italo House/Eurodance that you were into. Children are usually the last ones to clue into a new fad or trend -- especially in pop music -- and Hip House was the genre that brought House music to middle school dances, Bar Mitzvahs, and mixed gender birthday parties that play spin the bottle and other tween rites of passage.
Once a genre reaches that level of total saturation no one can lay claim to it anymore. It has become part of the pop culture zeitgeist, not to be controlled, only to be commentated. And driven by corporate ROI. It's like a viral outbreak that occasionally makes a few musicians and labels a lot of money.
With that said, there is a lot to appreciate about Hip House. Yeah, it got cheesy as all hell in the later period when everyone kept abusing the Think break (the "WOO! YEAH!" sample). But there is a sneaky charm about it, probably because it came from Belgium and next to the Italians the Belgians make the best electronic music of mainland Europe. You can never go wrong checking out a Belgian artist. Just imagine just how bad this genre would be if the Dutch made it instead? They'd probably fuck it all up, just like they fuck up everything.
Hip House did not last long, mostly because by 1992 the formula got a little stale and the endless music videos and sports montages contributed to oversaturation fatigue. By that point the genre bared little resemblance to the original sound coming out of Chicago, and it was produced almost exclusively by Europeans. Armed with rave anthems and pulsing new drum kicks, they evolved the sound into something even cheesier: Eurodance.
Ish.


## Hard House
*aka:  Booty House, Ghetto House, Juke, Footwork* in the House scene, emerged in mid 90s

Okay, pay attention to this part because this is going to sound slightly confusing.
Real Hard House is a specific style of music that came out of Chicago in the mid 90s, and its signature gimmick is all percussion 4-to-the-floor: A slightly overdriven kick, snare, hi-hat, tom, rimshot, clap, even cymbal (optional) on every beat. There is almost nothing off-beat. This gives it a very simple but distinct "THACK THACK THACK THACK" sound. It's nothing complicated or original, but it is fairly distinctive in a scene that prefers bouncey off-beat goodness.
Added to this percussive madness are very lo-fi samples and instrumentation, making the genre rough, gritty, and ghetto (Ghetto Tech is Detroit's response to Chicago Hard House. Both genres have since evolved into two competing factions: The Jits vs the Jukes. Don't ask me which is which).
What makes this confusing is that there is another form of Hard House in the UK inappropriately called Hard House that came about in the late 90s and has nothing to do with Chicago Hard House. It came from NRG (ie: The Hard Dance scene) and it sounds really corny and not at all like its namesake. Back in the day I called it Stupid House.
To add to the confusion, there is an almost identical-sounding genre that emerged in Belgium in the late 90s called Jumpstyle, and it has nothing to do with Chicago Hard House either (that I know of). They just somehow came across the "all percussion on the beat" technique at roughly the same time, or slightly later. In biological taxonomy terms, this is what we call convergent evolution.
What would Hard House be without the Underground Construction label? ....probably something people think came from England.
There is a forerunner to Hard House called Ghetto House, a shortlived early 90s genre that was a stripped down, minimalist approach to Chicago's already minimal production gloss, with lyrics about drugs and living life in the ghetto. Within a year or two it ironed out into a decidedly addictive template and got harder and nastier.
Chicago Hard House emerged as a battle genre more than any other House genre. The tracks are simple and short so a competent DJ has to be fast, fader slamming records every 8 or 16 bars, utilizing samples and scratching throughout. Some Hard House DJs have even competed in the DMC.
A fun subgenre of Hard House is the much heralded Booty House which is simply Hard House with raunchy Dirty South lyrics and samples. It is championed by DJ Funk, the only DJ I've ever seen who can scratch while getting sucked off underneath the table (I'm not making that up. Girl was on her knees and everything. She may have been part of his entourage and it's a bit they do at his shows.)
You know what DJ Funk wants. You know what DJ Funk needs.
Hard House isn't called Hard House anymore due to the confusion mentioned above. The modern name for it is "Juke" music, and it's at war with the Detroit Jits over who can lay claim to inventing the dance style "Footwork". Don't ask me why this matters to people. Humans will compete over anything.

## Chicago House
*aka:  Classic House, House, Jackin House* in the House scene, emerged in mid 80s

Chicago House was invented by gay black dudes in Chicago's southside in the mid 80s. It is almost inadvertently responsible for nearly 1/3 of all the music on this entire guide, and it is 90% of the reason why you have even heard of electronic music at all. These stats are irrefutable.
Chicago House gets its name from an actual Disco club called the Warehouse. It is NOT, as some people have come to think of it, a generic name synonymous with "club" or "dance" music; a euphemism for the default, stock or basic option in goods and services, as in the "house band" or "house special" or "house blend" or "house brewery on tap" or "houseboat" or "clearinghouse".
House has since split into six scenes and over thirty genres and subgenres on this guide alone (and there are easily hundreds more).
According to legend, it was at that fabled Warehouse nightclub that the late great legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles (not to be confused with Frankie Bones who is also famous but for different reasons) would cane Disco records alongside Soul, Funk, R&B, Italo Disco/Hi NRG, Rock, Rap, Pop and anything else he could get his hands on, up to and including the kitchen sink.
What Frankie Knuckles might look like.
Like Larry Levan's residency at the Paradise Garage in New York, people came to call Knuckles' eclectic sets "Warehouse music" or just "house music" but there was one crucial ingredient missing that would turn his warehouse music into capital-H House music.
Ironically, Knuckles left the Warehouse in 1983 before House music was a thing. He found a new club -- The Powerplant -- and subsequently the Warehouse was renamed the Music Box and continued on with another famous musical director, Ron Hardy. But the "house music" appellation followed Knuckles and both venues became monster players in the rise of electronic dance mu--that is, electronic music that people dance to.
On advice from Derrick May (because electronic music history is a collaboratively contrived effort like Star Wars plots), Frankie Knuckles soon picked up the secret weapon that would come to define his sets and change music forever: A Roland TR-909 drum machine.
What a TR-909 might look like.
Less mechanical and slightly warmer than the TR-808, The 909 was Roland's second attempt at making an analog drum machine with synthesized sounds (sort of), before sample-based drum machines and samplers took over the market. Knuckles would employ one of these in his sets, laying down a thick 4-to-the-floor groove underneath everything he played, creating an addictive, beefed up kick that drove club patrons wild.
Another important thing the 909 gave the world was its delicious clap. When laid out in succession, it sounds like someone saying "Jack", giving House music its first ever audio meme. When you hear the House music go jak-jak-jak-jackin', you know it's the original Chicago sound.
By leaving the 909 running and looping grooves all night long, and armed with reel-to-reel tapes that he personally edited into remixes and supercuts, Knuckles had created an atmosphere of repetitive permanance, of songs blending together, of a new style of music that shackled off all notions of pop songcraft.
No more was one waiting for the chorus, or the bridge, or the vocals, or anything that followed the standard "song" structure. With a 909 and looping Disco records what more was needed? There was no chorus, bridge, anthem, drop or breakdown. The part of the song that you're waiting for is right now. There is no hook because every part is the hook. This is the legacy that House music leave us.
(A slightly weaker argument can be made that the repetition of House somewhat borrows from the Blues stanza where the 2nd line repeats the 1st, the 3rd line deviates, and the 4th line is the rhyming payoff, ie: AABA. House takes it one step further and goes AAAB, where the first three lines repeat and the 4th line is the deviate/payoff. At least, I think that's what they were doing)
It also didn't hurt that the drug Ecstasy had reached Chicago by the 80s, and the rushing body buzz of the drug went hand in hand with the relentless thump and never-give-up style of music. Because there is something genuinely addictive about the the raw, unprocessed, original Chicago House sound. It's so minimalist, repetitive, fearless, and uncompromising. Clubbers these days may find it dated or of poor quality but I think it only adds to its charm. I don't expect today's audiences to understand it. Because not everybody understands House music. It's a spiritual thing, a body thing, a soul thing.
Demand was high for these live renditions to be pressed to wax, so when Chicago House producers hit the studio to cut tracks, each producer added their own style to it, expanding the pantheon. Farley "Jackmaster" Funk & Jessie Saunders made it epic, Larry Heard made it deep, Steve "Silk" Hurly made it jack, Marshall Jefferson added pianos, Ron Hardy added divas, Fast Eddie added rapping and Phuture added acid.
Chicago House gave us the over-the-top sassy diva, the funky bassline, the piano fill, the sweaty gay monologue, the acid line, the gospel chorus, and of course that omipresent 909 kick.
It also gave us a lot of lyrics about House music. Not since Rock n Roll has any music genre loved to talk about itself so much. Where Rock made things personal with the "I like to Rock" motif, House made things general with insistant "This is House music" references (or just random "Chicago!" call outs), just in case people forgot what they were listening to.
1986 was the landmark year Chicago House broke out of the gay clubs and onto the record charts. Within a year the music made it overseas. A year after that it conquered the world and everyone was scrambling to make their own House music. Ironically, despite its global reach and success it still wasn't recognized much in its home town (a recurring pattern with electronic musicians, especially in North America: Popular everywhere but home).

White news anchors trying to make sense of gay black music.
	

Chicago House spawned more children than Jacob in the Bible and each carved out its own destiny like the Tribes of Israel. Some were so popular that they won Grammys and Teen Choice Awards, and others were so antithetical to the classic House sound that they could scarcely be considered House at all. By the mid 90s House was so prevalent that the original Chicago House sound was forsaken for its friendlier, less-gay and less-black descendents.
That's not to say Chicago House is a complete relic forgotten to time and mystery. Its history has been well-preserved and every so often a producer -- often someone who's never been to Chicago before -- will release a throwback track, as either a tribute or a gesture of respeck knuckles.

Let me take you back to the oldskool...when House music talked about House music. And Chicago.
	

Respeck Knuckles indeed.

# Acid

## Acid House
*aka:  Acid* in the Acid scene, emerged in mid 80s

Acid House is House music with acid. What is acid? It's a rubbery, squiggly, bubbly, whirrbly, trippy, bouncey, warpy, funky, filthy, screaming, squelching, barking, blistering, scratching, ripping, dripping, driving, liquid-like hypnotic mutant synthline produced by a little silver box called the Roland TB-303 Bassline.
It's not very big -- only about 30 centimetres long. If you're reading this on a big monitor, this is almost its exact size.
This little unit is probably more important than any other gear in electronic music history, so let me go on a bit of an aside here.
Released in 1981, the original purpose of the 303 was to serve as a bassline sequencer for guitarists (the TB means "Transistor Bass"). And it does produce good basslines (listen to Newcleus - Jam On It or Mantronix - Bassline for examples). It was often paired with its similar-looking sibling the Roland TR-606 Drumatix drum machine, helping lonely guitarists everywhere pretend that they have a band. Or at least some friends.
10,000 units were made. It did not sell well and 18 months later the 303 was taken off the market. And that's the last anyone had ever heard of it... in an alternate universe where things make sense and random accidents don't happen which is definitely not the universe we live in.
Instead, five years later bargain bin House producers in the southside of Chicago picked up some cheap 303s and started fiddling around with them.
According to legend, the original instructions for using the 303 specified it as a "set it and forget it" device. But Japanese tech products in the 80s were notorious for their terrible instruction manuals full of broken english and convoluted techsplaining. Sometimes it was more frustrating just trying to understand the manual than it was actually learning the device so producers often dove into gear headfirst without knowing exactly what they were doing or whether they were doing it properly.
So whereas proper usage of the 303 was to notate the melody, set the knobs at the desired levels and then press play, nobody in Chicago in the mid 80s actually did that. Instead they pushed play and twisted the knobs while it was running (something the original designers did not intend). The sound that came out was the most alien thing to happen to music since Elvis escaped from Area 51.
There are a number of legendary stories about how this weird sound got its name and who gave it that name (possibly Ron Hardy), but it was a perfectly apt description: Acid. No better word could describe it. It was Acid. It could be a reference to drugs, but it was a better reference to the sound it made. It may have also been a reference to the sound it made on drugs.
Now that I'm done gushing over the 303, let's clarify some things about this legendary genre.
First off, this is Acid House, not 303 House. Which means not all music with a 303 in it is Acid.
Secondly, Acid does not have to use a 303. Anyone who tells you that is a purist snob. You can make Acid with any device that has the requisite filter knobs that accomplish Acid's signature wibbly wobbly timey wimey sound, and there are a number of non-303s that can accomplish this like the SH-101, MC-202, Juno 106, Jupiter 8, FR-777, Korg Prophecy or any number of off-303 clones out there including Devilfish, Rebirth, Reason, or you can download the schematics and order the components and make your own X0X box from scratch if you have the electronics know-how. Acid is not limited to just the 303 and its derivatives.
Acid music is not defined by the device, it is defined by the sound. It's not the device that makes Acid, it's what you do with it. So Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat, while fascinating, is not Acid House. Neither is aforementioned Jam On it or On and On.
To talk about Acid House, we must start at the beginning, and the beginning is Phuture - Acid Tracks, a 12 minute stomper that is just a beat and a single looping 303 line, and someone just going to town on those knobs. It's the twisting of the knob part that makes acid Acid.
Acid House was the first genre of electronic music to get a type of party named after it - the Acid House party. It was a hit in Chicago and the Midwest, and it became an even bigger hit in the UK in the summer of 88 (the so-called Second Summer of Love), where vacationing partiers heard it in Ibiza for the first time while also taking ecstasy for the first time (the two compliment each other like a duck's boner and dragging weeds).
They brought the experience back with them to the UK and a year later raves were born. There are tons of books, memoirs and documentaries written about this period because every generation thinks its first exposure to something is the best that something has ever been. And if you get famous later on for doing something, you too will mythologize your origins.

The one, the only, the original Chicago Acid House sound.
	

Acid House is so important and so instrumental in the making and the modelling of modern rave and club culture that it can't die, won't die, and will never really be forgotten. And to think it owes itself entirely to a bunch of impatient producers on Chicago's southside who neglected to read an instruction manual.
Life is fortuitous like that.
Ish.


## Acid
*aka:  Acid Techno, Acid Trance, Funky Acid, Acid Disco, Acid Downtempo, Acid Dub, Acid Ambient, Acid Chill, Balearic Acid, ACIEEED!* in the Acid scene, emerged in late 80s

Acid is huge. Really huge. Unlike other long-standing scenes like Electro that have ebbed and flowed in popularity over the years, Acid has never really gone out of style. The 303 is so versatile that it never sounds dated (which is impossible since it sounds futuristic to begin with) and people are always making more Acid and there are a million permutations of Acid genres.
Acid is one of the few scenes where being a genre Nazi is not very useful. That's not to say Acid snobs don't exist, but those are mostly "303 only" purist snobs rather than "Tech Acid vs Acidtech" snobs and who cares what they think.
So I'm not really adamant about cutting Acid up into divergent subgenres. The people who love Acid aren't that anal about it and have no reason to be. To them, it's all just Acid. And I'm the same way. This is one of those cases where less is more.
Beyond the original Chicago Acid House sound, there are really only two kinds: Acid and Hard Acid.
Acid is what happened to Acid House when it was exported overseas and taken up by a second generation of musicians far removed from the birthing pool of Chicago's southside. Like Hardfloor -- the AC/DC of Acid. Sure, they keep making the same song over and over, but it's a totally awesome song and you never get tired of hearing it.
In just a few short years there was Acid Techno, Acid Trance, Acid Dub, Acid Breaks (sufficiently covered with Chemical Breaks), Acid Disco, Acidcore, Acid Downtempo, Ambient Acid, Funky Acid, and anything else one could think of doing with a 303. Except for genres already listed elsewhere in this guide, let's just call it Acid. It's all Acid.
The earliest Acid records were obviously trying to emulate the raw minimalist sounds coming out of Chicago, but it didn't take long before they added their own aesthetics like pads, leads, hooks and choruses. And iconography:
Have a nice trip.
Paired with a rallying cry "ACIEEED!" and a new drug called ecstasy and you have the reason you're reading this right now. Rave culture starts here, and this period is so well documented it has its own mythology (because there is nothing UK music writers love writing about more than UK music and its indelible importance, accompanied by lots of exhaustive superlatives).
According to legend it all started when best mates Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway, Johnny Walker and Paul Oakenfold (yes, that Paul Oakenfold) took a vacation to the subtropical island of Ibiza for Oakenfold's birthday in the summer of 87. It was there in the infamous Amnesia nightclub that they discovered Balearic music, Acid House and of course ecstasy, and it changed their lives so irrevocably that they could no longer return to the hum-drum life they once led.
(Perhaps because of this incident, or as an effect of it, Ibiza has since transformed from a hippie getaway into a bloated, overwrought trashy tourist trap for self-entitled rich snobs eager to overpay for shitty drugs and shittier famewhore DJs caning marked-up trendwhore garbage in sardine-packed nightclubs -- but I digress).
When they got back to England, like all newbie ravers they yearned to share their wonderful experience with their friends (and by friends I mean the rest of the country), so they each set up clubs with intentions of capturing in England the feelings and memories of that wonderful Mediterranean summer. Danny set up Shoom, Nicky set up Trip, Paul set up Heaven, and Johnny played at all of them (but they were all DJs).
The lads start a musical revolution at Danny's club Shoom in 88.
The lore passed into legend and before long this euphoric Balearic vibe, stimulated with appropriate psychotropics, spread like wildfire across the British Isles. The demand for Acid records was easily met, but the demand for illicit substances was not. To fill the need, club owners and patrons turned to more unsavory sources, courting travelers, street gangs, and football hooligans who sold drugs that were just as stimulating but not as euphoric.
And just like that the Balearic bliss of the Acid House Age was gone. It barely lasted a year. The drugs got weaker and nastier so the music got harder, faster and more aggressive.
None of this has anything to do with Acid music. I just want to make the point that the music got harder probably because of shitty drugs. While correlation does not imply causation, drugs are probably a bigger driver of trends and fads in electronic music than everyone feels comfortable admitting.

Ishkur's special 3:03 mix of all the Acid music.
	

Acid has seen a resurgence lately because everything retro is cool, and the big thing among hipsters is to mimic the authentic retro experience as close as possible, right down to the minimalist programming and lack of compression or production gloss, so the music sounds like something that genuinely came from the 80s.
I have no reason to complain about that.
Ish.


## Hard Acid
*aka:  Hard Acid Techno, Hard Acid Trance* in the Acid scene, emerged in early 90s

The 303 really is a unique piece of hardware.
It is unique for the distinctive sound it produces, the versatility of its sound and the ease by which you can manipulate that sound in real time, but it can't do everything. For a special brand of Acid -- Hard Acid -- the sound needs to be overdriven into something harsh and nasty. It needs a distortion box. 
Any distortion box will do (I won't give recommendations -- there are far too many to choose), but for symbolism's sake get one with a guitar distortion pedal. You can at least pretend you are Jimi Hendrix when you go to town on those knobs and light your 303 on fire.
Although to be fair a guitar probably burns better.
The distortion box changed Acid music in much the same way the guitar distortion pedal changed rock music in the 60s. It turned a funky lead synth (and occasional bassline) into a barking, growling anthem stomper.
Hard Acid arrived soon after regular Acid, and of course was still just called Acid at the time. But it wasn't birthed in the lovey dovey Acid House parties or Balearic clubnights, it was more in line with what was going on at those free teknival rave parties in the UK, with the hard pounding Techno music and mobile sound systems. This wasn't Acid for doing drugs and making out with your friends, this was Acid for doing drugs and "Gettin' off yer fuckin' 'ead!"
The overdriven acid line became more popular than regular trippy Acid, which seemed too druggy and counter-cultural for the normals. But hard, fistpumping acid lines? That's something the frat rock crowd can appreciate on a pertinent cerebral level.
Hard acid lines are some of the most famous melodies in electronic music and are frequently found in sports hilight reels, commercials about cool futuristic products or gadgets, and of course movies.
The infamous blood rave at the beginning of Blade just wouldn't be so iconic if it wasn't accompanied by New Order - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction), a 10 minute Acid anthem that has become the most famous Hard Acid track that you probably didn't know was Hard Acid, all because of that movie.

One thing about raves I never could stomach..... all the damn vampires.
	

Because of their addictive quality, hard blistering acid lines are spread out over many genres, including Hard Techno, German Trance, Hardcore (Acidcore), Freeform/UK Hardcore, Chemical Breaks, Goa/Psy Trance and its derivatives, and sometimes even EBM and Futurepop but only as an accessory.
But the true Hard Acid sound is found with Techno aesthetics (and to a lesser extent Trance because Trance has a tendency to cheese things up, even Hard Acid), and despite being such a popular sound it's only dominated by a few artists and pretty much one label: Stay Up Forever, run by the dedicated Liberator crew. 



Ishkur's Ultimate Hard Acid mix that is half Stay Up Forever
	

Hard Acid, like all hard and aggressive genres, prides itself on its permanence. So it will never die, never go away, and it will always be there to give it hard and fast for anyone who just wants to lose their mind for a night. And for that reason we salute Hard Acid, and by salute I mean fist pump.

# Breakbeat

## Freeland Breaks
*aka:  dook-dook-chak, dook-dook-chak* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in early 00s

It's Adam Freeland's fault we have Nu Skool Breaks. But he wasn't done there. He also gave us this which as far as I know doesn't have a name so I name it after him.
Yup, this guy.
Freeland Breaks is a microgenre but one too hilarious to pass up. It was a fad in the mid-00s Breaks scene to make something chuggy and Proggy without the Tearout nonsense, and sometimes without any breaks (many tracks are 4-to-the-floor. Just listen). Just as Nu Skool was a reaction to Big Beat, so too is Freeland a reaction to Nu Skool.
As a trend it didn't actually go anywhere nor did it achieve official "genre" status, but Breaks producers kept steadily making music adhering to a common theme over the years, trying to make it a thing but not quite getting there. Let me explain:
It all started with a single track: Smells Like Freeland, a low key, anti-tearout trendwhore remix of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit that took over the Breaks scene in 2003. Due to copyright infringement it was never released commercially so it remained -- and as far as I know still remains -- one of the most popular white labels ever.
The track itself has nothing much going for it. It borrows aesthetics from Prog with heavy reverb/echo on samples and a druggy, almost listless beat (real drums, not processed drum machine ratatats) that betrays the whole concept of breakbeat music. Maybe it was due to nostalgia, that for once the party people recognized the source sample from something that existed when they were alive. Or maybe they just liked it being different from the Tearout monotony.
At any rate Adam Freeland had another hit on his hands. He had already moved on from Nu Skool anyway, taken to dropping straight up rock music in his sets on occasion. His novelty Teen Spirit track would have remained a one-off except that he followed it up with another track that used The White Stripes. And then a year later someone replicated his formula using Smashing Pumpkin's 1979. And then someone did it again with KLF's What Time Is Love. Clearly there's a pattern going on here.
In researching this phenomenon, I actually discovered earlier proto-instances of it, sampling Blue Oyster Cult and a mashup between Age of Love and Daft Punk. That makes Freeland not the originator but merely the popularizer of this specific trend (popularizers always get the credit in music. That's just the way it goes).
This is Adam Freemer, one-time producer and DJ who doesn't make any Freeland Breaks. Though he oughta.
As it turns out, this is common enough to be established as something in Breaks, fascinating enough to compel me to track down all the music made in this style and possibly make a mix of it someday. But if it weren't for Freeland's monster hit this style wouldn't be important enough to put on this guide. That's why it's called Freeland Breaks and not Sample An Old Grunge Or Rock Song And Reverb The Fuck Out Of It With a 4-To-The-Floor-Kick Breaks.
Ish.


## Nu Skool Breaks
*aka:  Tearout Breaks, Nu Breaks, NuSkool Breaks, Nu Skool Breakbeat, Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu-Nu Skool Breakbeat bwa bwa bwa bwa* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in late 90s

Nu Skool Breaks was because Big Beat rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
Big Beat was just too corporate, too uplifting, too celebratory, too successful, too Hollywood. It made people dance and scream and go "ahhh!" like the metal concerts of yore. It was very popular and as we all know success attracts haters who are likely to do the exact opposite out of spite (this happens a lot in electronic music: Darkside is a reaction to Happy Hardcore, Progressive is a reaction to Eurotrance, Detroit Techno is a reaction to Detroit Techno, etc.).
Nu Skool Breaks started out as the anti-Big Beat. It was everything Big Beat was not: Dark, moody, full of atmospheric pads and rumbling basslines. There were no Hip Hop samples or shouty gang choruses or catchy "jammin on the 1" hooks.
It was originally coined by Rennie Pilgrim as a way to distance himself from the block rockin sounds filling the record charts, and while it held some interest as a micro genre with a placeholder name for some time, it may not have gone anywhere if not for Adam Freeland releasing this seminal mix of Nu Skool tunes in 99:
Another one of those mixes that is not very good but is a game changer nonetheless. And only half of it I would classify as Nu Skool.

This mix compilation absolutely flipped the script and injected Breaks with an attitude and a satisfying griminess that it had never really explored before. Once Breaks producers got it in their heads that they could put DnB bass in their songs, it was all over. Big Beat could not compete with the surly, growling anger erupting from the underground.
Before long it seemed Nu Skool Breaks was competing with Darkstep to see who could pump out the nastiest, grimiest basslines for the dancefloor. It was like a competition between Dieselboy vs Dieselbreaks, and it all depended on what tempo you liked your music. When oneupsmanship becomes the goal instead of making decent music, everyone suffers. Because then it's just a dick measuring contest, like an electronic equivalent of dueling banjos or cutting contests, and that kind of bullshit ruins genres (see Anthem House, Eurotrance, Jumpup, Brostep, Hardcore).
Like Big Beat before it, Nu Skool was also immolated by its own success. The breakdown-build-anthem formula made things banal and predictable, with 16 bar growling bassline anthems interrupted by 16 bar breakdowns all night long. A mutant strain of Nu Skool called Tearout Breaks was largely responsible for this. The anger and aggression was perfect for bro culture who latched onto it until they found a better calling through Brostep (and to a lesser extent Pendulum.
What a tearout break might look like.
Nu Skool Breaks are still around and dominate the Breaks scene for the most part but they're hardly Nu anymore. But that's okay -- once names are settled it's hard to change them. Just look at Newfoundland and that was 500 years ago. It's not Newfoundland anymore. And just where is the original Foundland anyway? Did we somehow lose Foundland? So if we find it again, will we call it Lostandfoundland?
That's my Deep Thought.
Ish.


## Big Beat
*aka:  Block Rockin' Beats* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in mid 90s

While Chemical Breaks was mostly an American thing, Big Beat was mostly a UK thing.
Big Beat is the most commercial genre of Breaks but not necessarily the worst (that would be Nu Skool). Legend purports that it got its name from the club Big Beat Boutique, where a then unknown DJ called Fatboy Slim would cane these kinds of tracks. That might be apocryphal (the Fatboy Slim inventing Big Beat thing, not the Fatboy Slim residency at Big Beat Boutique thing), but I don't have any issues in claiming that Fatboy Slim is largely responsible for Big Beat. It's all his fault. I don't hold that against him.
Yup, it's all this guy's fault.
Big Beat took the essential structure of Chemical Breaks and removed the druggy Chemical elements from it (like Lithium, Polonium and Bismuth), replacing it with family-friendly basslines, singalong lyrical content and vocal shoutouts, warm melodies with hooks made from accessible tropes like guitar riffs, horn fanfares and strings, scratching and samples of scratching, and even old blues samples.
Such an irredeemable combination meant Breaks could break through (pun unintended) as one of the commercial genres riding the "Electronica" explosion of the late 90s.
Big Beat still adhered to the Funky Drummer cadence of its progenitors although by the late 90s Clyde Stubblefield's infamous drum break was rarely sampled and producers would just re-create it on their own gear with heavy compression, distortion, EQ and filtering. But Big Beat's signature sound came from the big booming bass kick on the one of every bar -- heavier, thicker, and more prominant than the rest of the percussion.
This is called "jammin on the 1", to mean always coming on strong on the first beat of every bar. You could probably blame the Chemical Brothers for popularizing it but they neither invented it nor came up with it. It's an old 70s Funk staple.
Big Beat was the official music genre of choice for late 90s advertisements, video games, sporting events, and of course action movies. From The Matrix to Resident Evil to Blade to Mortal Kombat, every time a scene called for a skin-tight PVC-clad 110 lb. lithe female who ordinarily couldn't punch through a wet paper bag effortlessly wushu her way through multitudes of mooks by flip jumping and swing kicking them in the face all without messing her hair or makeup, Big Beat is there to make her look cool doing it (or at least make the scene sound cool).

 Today's action movies have the taiko drums but late 90s early 00s action movies were all about the Big Beat breaks.
	

Thanks to the Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy winning Grammys, Big Beat was for a short period the arena rock of electronic music. And that's when the suits took over, diluting it down into its essence with massive builds and big shiny beats, and selling it in shopping malls and MTV, and everything got boring, predictable, and formulaic. There's an entire generation that grew up idolizing this swill and decided ten years later to do the same thing to Dubstep.
When an electronic act lands the cover of a rock magazine, you know things have gone meteoric.
Big Beat may still be around, but it definitely overdosed on itself after 2000. The remnants of Big Beat went on to something even more unforgiveable -- Nu Skool Breaks.
Ish.


## Chemical Breaks
*aka:  Acid Breaks* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in early 90s

It can be argued that Chemical Breaks actually came before Breaks became Breaks. They just didn't call it Chemical Breaks. Or even just Breaks.
The earliest Breaks were spooled off Acid House, usually as simple acid lines with old drum break samples rather than a looping 808 kick, or as remixes of Acid House (or cross-overs from Chill Out or Industrial -- that happened sometimes, for instance Meat Beat Manifesto). The introduction of breakbeats to Acid gave it some variety, but it was still called Acid House at the time.
While Orbital did make some famous Breakbeat tracks and Breaks was their go-to rhythm of choice, I would not consider them a Breakbeat act.
New scenes and genres don't generally spring off from existing ones immediately. There is an overlap period, a Venn diagram era where a new sound might be considered part of an old sound until taken up by a second generation of impartial observers, aided by catchy marketing. This might take anywhere from 1-3 years depending on how popular the sound is (more popular genres fragment more quickly, out of sheer volume).
So deciding when Acid House became Breaks with Acid which eventually became Acid Breaks is an academic argument that no one at the time cared about and no one has any definitive answer. And I don't really care either. It's still pretty fuzzy, suffice to say that when it did emerge as its own scene, with its own fashion and lingo and audience, it had already jumped into other scenes as well, including Hardcore, Chill Out, and Jungle.
When Acid Breaks emerged as its own thing, it was not just using acid anymore, but merely any synth that could deliver the liquid rubbery sound of the Roland TB-303, and when they couldn't find one they used arpeggiation or gates to approximate the trippy, funky, skippety skip-hop whirrbly whobbly effects of Acid without much deviation.
This was such a distinctive feature that it became known as Chemical Breaks (because it wasn't strictly Acid but it was synthetic), and I should mention that the name did not come from the Chemical Brothers because they were called the Dust Brothers at the time (they had to change their name when the real Dust Brothers -- of Beastie Boys and Fight Club fame -- objected) and it was a decidedly American invention, specifically the Moontribe collective of California's legendary funky desert raves which coincided with the rise of neo-hippies, counterculturalism, radical art-stunt statements, and the first Burning Man.
Sometimes all a genre needs is a smash hit mix to push it into prominence.
Chemical Breaks retains the oldskool trippiness of trying to maximize one's drug high which really should be the driving goal of all rave-based music. Too many producers lose sight of what their music is for, that they try to attain some loftier perception of their music changing lives or forwarding culture when it really does none of those things. It's just fun to listen to on drugs, and Chemical Breaks is a genre that doesn't lose sight of that.
Chemical Breaks blew up when everything rave did in the late 90s, and acts like The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Chemical Brothers and Uberzone became household names, either through Mortal Kombat compilations or through action movie soundtracks. This makes Chemical Breaks one of the accompanying genres that make up "Electronica". But it wasn't the Breakbeat genre with the most commercial success -- that would go to its successor Big Beat.
Fucking Big Beat.
Ish. 


## Breaks
*aka:  Breakbeat, Funky Breaks, Breakbeat House* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in late 80s

Not all electronic music has a 4-to-the-floor kick.
There's also Breakbeat or Breaks, the scene (and main genre of that scene) that specifies in its very name that it does not have a 4-to-the-floor kick.
The word "breaks" comes literally from the old drum breaks in 60s and 70s funk, soul, disco and R&B songs in which the music would stop and the drummer would continue unaccompanied for a bar or two, making it perfect for sampling.
The earliest Breaks were exactly that -- looping drum breaks, coming of age at a time when sampling was king and there was nothing the suits could do about it.
Like Hip Hop, the earliest Breakbeat records sampled the living shit out of old vinyl records, in some cases the exact same beats and breaks that Hip Hop sampled (and you know them already and you have heard them in thousands of tracks: Funky Drummer, Amen, Scorpio, Take Me To The Mardi Gras, Ashley's Roachclip, Think, The Champ, Apache, etc), making Breaks basically a sped up instrumental form of Hip Hop.

Here the late great "Funky Drummer" Clyde Stubblefield demonstrates that good drumming isn't about speed or technical proficiency, it's about feel. About groove and timing. A good break isn't just some sequenced percussion sounds, it instills a mood. With one snare hit he puts every double-time speed metal drummer and 32 tom Canadian prog rock wanker to shame.
	

But like most other genres that relied on heavy sampling (New Beat and Collage especially), the creative musical expression of cannibalizing old songs as a popular and commercial artform was crushed by legislation in the 90s. And just as well because sampling has never been about commercialization and it works best as an underground renegade artform that shuns popularity and money, like slam poetry or Banksy graffiti. It will always exist. It just won't ever chart.
After the "sample a naked drum break from a 70s R&B hit" period which was pretty much over by the late 90s, Breaks settled into something fresh, funky, and inventive. Divorced from the 4-to-the-floor kick it was free to do anything it wanted, anything at all. The only limit was itself, like Zombocom.
But as is the case with a lot of new electronic music genres, after the initial "wild west" period where different things are tried with varying degrees of success and failure, things settle into one or two decided formats, usually spearheaded by a very popular song or two. This is what creates genres and subgenres.
For Breaks, it was the decision that James Brown Clyde Stubblefield - Funky Drummer is the best drum break of all time. Jungle has the Amen, but Breaks has the Funky Drummer.
To me, the pure Breakbeat sound is one that focuses ostensibly on the break and nothing else. The break is the reason for the track's existence and it has no need for drops or breakdowns or anthems or tearout basslines any other such nonsense that gets in the way of a good groovy percussion.
Several other genres in this scene use the break as a backdrop for something else -- acid for Chemical Breaks, bassline for Nu Skool Breaks, rock for Big Beat. But breaks in its essence is about the breakbeat and should be nothing but.

A journey through the history of Breaks, starting with the earliest sample-and-loop Breaks, moving through Funky Breaks, Chemical Breaks, Big Beat, and then some other nonsense. But no Nu Skool because seriously now.
	

Breaks has been hi-jacked by its descendents, all of them trying to make Breaks more than what it is. But at the core of it all, Breaks has always been about the funky breakbeat. If it doesn't have that, then it's not Breaks.
Ish.


## Progressive Breaks
*aka:  Atmospheric Breaks, Balearic Breaks, Deep Progressive Breaks, Ambient Breaks, Intelligent Breaks, Breaktrance, Vocal Progressive Breaks* in the Breakbeat scene, emerged in late 90s

Every scene has its sensitive, mature side, where it wants to be regarded as a serious and important work of art; that its music is more than just teeth-chattering low frequencies for mashed out kids gnawing their faces off.
In the Breakbeat scene, this genre is Progressive Breaks.
It can be argued about when, exactly, this all started. You could say it started with Orbital (or even Scott Hardkiss) but I wouldn't want to do that because Orbital seems to defy classification.
A better relationship seems to line up with what's going on in Progressive House and Trance at the time (especially in the UK). Or whatever Sasha and Digweed were playing since they were the water carriers for this type of sound throughout the entirety of the 90s.
Progressive Breaks likes to use a lot of blissful sci-fi imagery of potential realities that will never happen, like trancecrackers coming over to the Break scene through the gateway genre of Progressive Breaks.
The earliest Progressive Breaks records were classified as Breaktrance and a lot of the early artists (like Hybrid, General Midi, Way Out West, and maybe even BT) cut their teeth in Progressive Trance/House and were exploring new sonic possibilities that did not involve a 4-to-the-floor kick. And a lot of early Progressive Breaks records were simply remixes of Progressive House and Trance -- the b-side Breaks remix that Trance DJs never played unless their name was Sasha.
So half of this genre sounds like Progressive House/Trance with breaks. The other half sounds like its trying to be Orbital. It can get cheesy at times, with the washy pads and twinkly leads and sometimes even ethnic vocals (without going full Worldbeat), but it certainly does not sound like any other Breaks, shedding the Hip Hop motifs entirely.
Maybe it helps that it actually pulls influences from other scenes for inspiration, the way a dachsund tries to look like a dog. And besides: What's wrong with a little comedown set here and there after a night of headbanging to White Snake Tearout anthems?
Progressive Breaks has a massive number of miscellaneous subgenres: Atmospheric Breaks, Balearic Breaks, Deep Progressive Breaks, Intelligent Breaks -- essentially a Breaks equivalent of every Prog genre that exists including McProg -- it's called Vocal Progressive Breaks. It's a general truism in electronic music that any genre with "vocal" in the name is donky dung.
The future is a hellish dystopia where everyone's needs are taken care of and they all live in the clouds and listen to Progressive Breaks.
Progressive Breaks is still around today because being a Breaks version of essentially another scene ensures it indefinite survival, like a domesticated animal that will never go extinct because man depends on it too much as a ready source of food. That's what Progressive Breaks is: The chicken of electronic music.
From an evolutionary standpoint, there's no better sure thing than that.
Ish.

# Drum n Bass

## Ragga Jungle
*aka:  The Superior Jungle To All Other Jungle* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in early 90s

Ragga Jungle is the Superior Jungle To All Other Jungle.
It is the purest and probably earliest form of Jungle although there's no way of knowing for sure. Some genres have definite, settled origins and others do not; it all depends on how much they care about their own history and make efforts to write it down before they forget things. Some genres seem to be better at it than others.
This music can make you lose your shit in 15 seconds. You absolutely can not listen to it without waving your arms in the air like one of those giant inflatable tube men outside car dealerships. I mean, that's what I do. I call it the Grover workout. Doesn't everyone do that? No? Just me?

Or spaz out like a religious revival, cf. Baptazia, Andy C and MC GQ.
	

All Drum n Bass genres have MCs but some use them more than others. Ragga Jungle uses them the most.
Drum n Bass MCs aren't like Hip Hop MCs. Some rhyme but most are just glorified hype-men. And some are quite good but most just sound like they're trying to eat a set mousetrap.
Ragga Jungle is such a deceptively simple genre, composed of only two ingredients:
- Dancehall rapping and reggae tropes.
- The amen break.
That's it. This is the genre that the amen break really came into prominence as the world's most important break sample. Other samples have dominated certain genres before (like the Planet Rock break for Freestyle or the Numbers break for Technobass which is technically also the Planet Rock break), but the amen break created and dominated an entire scene and culture of music -- Drum n Bass, formerly Jungle (more on this later).
Quite possibly millions of records spanning 30 years, thousands of record labels and artists, and dozens of genres and subgenres almost exclusively devoted to the employment of a 6-second slice of music from the b-side of an R&B hit from 1969: Amen, Brother.
For the hearing impaired this is what the amen break looks like.
What makes the amen break so special? Some like the big booming kick, but the most addictive element is the rat-a-tat snare, coming at you with the frenetic ferocity of a machine gun. I could go on about the amen break's importance and versatility, but I think its easier if I just let Nate Harrison explain it in this excellent video essay:




The amen break is what gave the scene its namesake: Jungle. There are many theories on how it acquired this name. One legend purports that it was named after a ghetto in Kingston, Jamaica called the "concrete jungle", but that wasn't its origin because Ragga Jungle did not come from Jamaica, it came from Jamaicans living in the UK (an important but irrelevent distinction).
Another theory suggests that it came from the title of an Oldskool Rave Hardcore track, quite possibly Paul Chambers aka Paul Ibiza, a late 80s and early 90s rave promoter and label owner who liked to claim that he invented the genre of Jungle because he was the first to coin that word in music and put it on a record sleeve (and even still, he probably wasn't the first to do that).
But if you go through his Ibiza Records discography it appears his "jungle" style is just bongo/tribal samples over Rave kicks -- no amen break which immediately disqualifies it as actual Jungle and hardly makes it responsible for the amen explosion that launched an entire scene a year later.

In other words Paul Ibiza is an originator but not the way he thinks he is just because he used the same name as something else that got really popular. It's like coming up with a new type of latex sex toy in the 70s called the Micro Soft. Yeah, the name got famous a few years later but not for anything you did.
And then there are those who insist that Jungle was a racist term since the people who made it were all black. Presumably because the original name "chicken n watermelon" didn't catch on. If they were white, what would it have been called instead? Golf Course n Yacht?
But probably the best explanation for the origin of "Jungle" is that the music just sounds like that word. Much like Acid, there is no better description of the raw, spastic tribal percussion of the amen break than that word. It just sounds jungley, and I don't mean that in a racist way, but rather in a "Marlowe going up the Congo river" way.
Paired with an Akai sampler-driven bassline and some Dancehall rapping for ethnic flavor, the name "Jungle" stuck. That is, until half a decade later when white people began making the music and they removed the reggae influences and even the amen break itself (a decision that is considered sacrilegious in some circles). At that point you couldn't call it Jungle anymore. It had become Drum n Bass.
So if you ever get into arguments over the difference between Jungle and Drum n Bass, or you are uncertain what to call a track or genre (or even this entire scene), a good measuring stick is the amen break. Does the track in question have it? Then it's Jungle. If not, call it Drum n Bass. This is an official decree from the Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium.
Ragga Jungle is still around today but along with the name Jungle it was primarily a 90s thing. As soon as the amen break was dropped in favor of the monotonous two-step drum kick, Jungle stopped being Jungle. It still exists today and every junglist will tell you that they have mad love for the oldskool Ragga sound even though they don't listen to it at home and only at parties. Personally I don't consider anything other than this to be real Jungle but that's the elitist in me.
Ish.



## Jumpup
*aka:  Jump Up, Clownstep, SUUUUUUUUUUPER JUMPUP* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 90s

Jumpup is the Eurotrance of Drum n Bass.
But where Eurotrance likes to put its breakdown (sometimes more than one) in the middle of the track, Jumpup puts it at the beginning. This makes for easy mixing, as every song has a 1.5 minute intro full of hip hop samples and "when will he drop it" teasers. Jumpup has been doing this since the late 90s, making the 2014 Saturday Night Live skit about the DJ who never drops the bass a very stale and tired 16 year old joke to anyone who has been in the scene for awhile. Good job making jokes that I made back in 99, Andy Samberg.
Jumpup did not invent the two-step drum kick (not to be confused with 2-Step Garage which is a genre that ironically does not use the two-step kick), but it's the genre that abused it the most, retiring the oldskool amen Jungle sound and ushering in the age of cleaner, whiter, more commercial family-friendly Drum n Bass.
Allow me to explain what the two-step drum kick is. Below is your standard quarter note 16-step drum sequencer, the basis of 98% of electronic music:
It's laid out in 4/4 time because that's what all modern music is, but there are ways to program 3/4, 5/4 and 2/4 into it. If you're feeling adventurous enough.
The standard House/Techno/Trance 4-to-the-floor drum pattern puts the kick on the first step of each quarter note (1-5-9-13) and put snares on the 2nd and 4th beats (5-13) to give it the classic House "thump chak thump chak" rhythm first popularized by Rock n Roll back in the 50s and every popular music genre since.
If you want to make that "oonce oonce oonce oonce" sound, put open hi-hats on 3-7-11-15 -- the off-beat cadence makes it "hotter" and gives it a bouncey feel, good for dancing.
So what does the two-step drum kick look like? Simple. It's this:

Just move the 3rd kick from 9 to 11.
That's it. That's all it is. It's exactly the same as House, Techno and all the rest, only move the 3rd beat over two steps. Doing this makes the kick/snare combination sound like they come in pairs due to the large gap between the 2nd and 3rd beats, hence the name two-step.
It is, at best, a token attempt at varying the drum programming in a genre that styles itself on inventive drum programming (it's in the name, after all). It is so lazy, so mindblowingly dull and paint-by-numbers that I'm surprised more junglists aren't insulted by anyone trying to pass off this pattern as genuine DRUM N BASS.
If you've ever bragged that Drum n Bass is superior to that 4-to-the-floor garbage in House because all it does is go "thump thump thump thump" endlessly, you really have no argument here. Your style is just as simple, just as formulaic, just as banal, and just as lily whitebread as the genres you sneer at in your Jungle forums and Facebook groups every day.
But what really sold Jumpup to the masses wasn't just the accessibility of its safe and boring drum programming, but its earworm basslines. They weren't rolling dark evil basslines like Darkstep, but rather light, funky basslines full of catchy hooks and jingles like Paul McCartney melodies, tossed out at the climax of drops and breakdowns like audio cotton candy.
Jumpup is cheesy, sugar-coated pop dance drivel. Fun for maybe a song or two every once in awhile, but not an entire set (or worse yet: An entire night of Jumpup anthems. If you've ever been completely tired of a gimmick...)
Aphrodite and Micky Finn are primarily to blame for this one (yes, they are both white. Extremely, terribly white). They didn't invent Jumpup but they codified it into a Stock-Aitken-Waterman style pop template factory through their label Urban Takeover, in which they pumped out a feverish number of hit records in the late 90s, each one exactly the same in structure and form. I remember seeing Aphrodrite at a festival in 2005 and he was still caning his old Urban Takeover hits from 1997. Because no one wants to hear his new stuff. Like he's Pink Floyd or something.
But I shouldn't be too hard on Jumpup. After all, it gave us the greatest filmed scene of any electronic music-based movie ever made, cf. Human Traffic:

BOH! MY SELECTAH! THA SOUNDS OF DA UNDAGROUND RENEGADE JUNGLE SOLJIA, LIVE AND IN EFFECT! MAKE SOME NOISE FOR THE BASS INSIDE THE ARENA!
	

As stupid as Jumpup is, it managed to get even stupider in later years. In the early 2000s a mutant strain of Jumpup flattened out the two-step kick into something 4-to-the-floor and took the bombastic basslines to Dutch levels (and you never want to go full Dutch with your music).
It was a hit with the college crowd and casual listeners of Drum n Bass but the true believers found it appalling. Sure enough within a year copycats flooded the record stores and the gatekeepers on the Dogs On Acid forums took to calling it Clownstep (at the time I was calling it SUUUUUUUUUUPER JUMPUP and you have to drag out the "SUUUUUPER" part for 3 seconds or more for full effect). Clownstep became such a pejorative term that it was eventually banned from the site.
But as corny as Clownstep was, nothing could prepare the Drum n Bass scene (or electronic music for that matter) for what was about to happen next.
Because what happened next was Pendulum.
Ish.


## Pendulum
*aka:  Nu Jumpup, Nu Skool Jumpup, Rock n Bass, Drum n Metal, dook chak dook-chak* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 00s

Pendulum is not the name of this genre. It's technically called Nu Jumpup or Nu Skool Jumpup but I call it Pendulum because Pendulum is more than just an artist or a genre.
It is an event.
It is one of those events that is so monumental that when people talk about history, they unconsciously draw a line between stuff that happened before the event and stuff that happened after (ie: "we are living in a post X world", where X is something earth-shattering like the atomic bomb or 9/11). We are witness to one of these life-changing events in Drum n Bass. Welcome to the Pendulum Age.
Pendulum hit Drum n Bass like a sledgehammer, leaving shock waves so powerful that it created one of those rifts between the oldskool junglist and the new junglists who came over specifically because of Pendulum.
And they're still coming, like some sort of DnB equivalent of Eternal September. In order to describe this phenomenon correctly, Pendulum is on this guide as a genre since all popular modern DnB sounds insufferably like Pendulum. But it's important to describe this sound in order to explain what it had done.
Simply put, Pendulum is simultaneously the best thing and the worst thing that has ever happened to Drum n Bass.
It was bound to happen: When a whole class of white people latch onto a music genre because of its raw in-your-face attitude, all it takes is one band to realize that this is Heavy Metal Parking Lot all over again. It's such an obvious recipe for success (sell raging headbanging DnB to metalheads) that I'm surprised it wasn't done sooner.
Pendulum was inevitable -- if not them, someone would have done it. But they arrived at the right time and in the right place like Elvis, The Beatles, Nirvana,  and every successful band that inadvertently changed the zeitgeist. Nu Metal was on the outs and the heavily tattooed Affliction T-shirt wearing Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit crowd were struggling for something to do on Saturday nights after watching the UFC fight. They came to this sound in droves. They came... for Pendulum.
And the band itself? They look like every other Nu Metal band.
Needs more Tapout Ts and a brick wall background. For that street cred.
And this is the problem when it comes to Pendulum. There's nothing about them that really suggests that they're Drum n Bass. They are an entirely different category onto themselves, bringing white Aussie bro culture to an insular black UK Jamaican scene. They are an actual band, making songs with verse-bridge-chorus structure, loud charging guitar riffs and pop hooks, and angry shouty vocals.
This is Rock n Bass, Drum n Metal, whatever you want to call it. It's Rage Against the Machine joining forces with Aphrodite to produce Dnbtron, the gestalt robot that junglists regard as both their savior and their curse.
The only connection Pendulum really has with Drum n Bass is the two-step drum kick which, if you've come here from Jumpup, is monotonous garbage. But it's not just the two-step kick that warrants their inclusion, it's their particular brand of it: Very tight and punchy kick hovering in the lower midrange so it doesn't interfere with the bass, and layered snares that are so tight they have neither high nor bottom end. Everything is a super compressed screaming midrange bowl of gumbo soup with this music.
This isn't Pendulum's fault -- it's actually a genius level of EQing and mastering because the kick is addictive as all hell. The problem is after they set this addictive template anyone who wanted to make uber-commercial Drum n Bass (which was apparently everyone) turned their brains off at the workstation and simply copied the Pendulum kick beat for beat, level for level, setting for setting.
That's not an uncommon thing (electronic music is rife with copycat sound techniques, a lot of them responsible for whole genres like Pendulum), but this is Drum n Bass. Your drum pattern isn't supposed to sound like everyone else's drum pattern. I even made a mix about this phenomenon. It's two hours of the same dook-chak kick running throughout (especially since I edited out the breakdowns. Seriously, fuck breakdowns).

This is actually a parody mix
	

So in 20 years Drum n Bass has gone from inventive and original drum programming to utilizing the two-step kick exclusively, to using a particular EQ setting of the two-step kick. And now it's a template that every producer just applies to everything to make tracks as quickly as possible. This genre has been stuck in this monotonous state since 2007, and now it's bled over into Liquid Funk. This almost makes me miss the annoying faux-rasta chatter of white MCs.
Now we have a bigger problem on our hands: An entire generation of partygoers has come and gone thinking Drum n Bass is the Pendulum sound. It's like a generation of filmmakers who loved the Michael Bay Transformers movies as children and are now inspired to make their own blockbusters with the same incoherence and mindless nonsense. Do you really want to watch a movie with zero attention or money spent on dialogue, plot, direction and characters?
That's what Pendulum genre is: The Michael Bay of Drum n Bass. 16 bars up, 16 bars down, bassline breakdown bassline breakdown, dook-chak two-step kick all night long. It's loud, obnoxious, occasionally impressive, but ultimately dull, soulless, and run off an assembly line devoid of any warmth or ingenuity. Every track is a carbon copy of each other. This is fast food DnB. It's not a culture, it's a mass-produced product.
Now don't get me wrong, I actually like Pendulum the band (far more than Pendulum the genre). It's good workout music -- really helps you push for that extra rep on the bench press. But it's in no way an example of Drum n Bass. It's just something that took over the scene and that says more about its fans than it does about the music.
And for that reason this stupid sound will stay with us forever. It will never go away because producers are envious and in order to get a booking at Ultra and Glastonbury they have to make this stupid shiny plastic music for grandmothers and 8-year-olds who will only like it if Beyonce is on the remix. Scene? What scene? This is no scene. This is commercial exploitation. Drum n Bass is dead and Pendulum killed it.
As for the band themselves? Oh they broke up years ago -- a victim of their own crushing success. They decided being The Definition of DnB was just too much and was not what they signed up for (and good on them for recognizing that).
There are always rumblings of their return but keep in mind that every time they do something new they get more divorced from the Drum n Bass sound they started out with. Their next project might even be punk. But that's okay because the damage has been done and there's no putting the toothpaste back in the bottle.
In the meantime two of them formed a side project to make shitty Brostep. That's always been where their heart was anyway. They belong with their fellow Ed Hardy douches.
Ish.
And for fucks sakes, Rob, shave that god damn goatee. You look like you have a vagina on your chin.



## Drumstep
*aka:  Dubstep* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in late 00s

Drum n Bass loves Dubstep.
Drum n Bass loves UK Garage in general, in much the same way the Germans love David Hasselhoff. The two scenes are very close and they pollinate each other's genres often with artists, labels, and consumers frequently partaking in both. I should probably make more of a close link between the two but unfortunately six other scenes are in the way and I'm not going to draw a line through 35 genres. Music maps with criss-crossing lines are stupid.
At its outset Dubstep was often the music of choice in the second room/chill area of Drum n Bass parties in the 2000s. It was the perfect counterweight because it was just like Drum n Bass, only half speed.
I wish there could be some grand accidental tale about the genre being accidentally invented by accident when some heavily accented DJ accidentally took an axe to a Darkstep record at 33 (that has happened before -- see New Beat) so they called it the axe incident, but nothing in the tale of that act of descent would ever act as an incentive in the actual ascension of Dubstep. Dubstep was not an access dent -- wait what the fuck am I talking about?
Yes, this exists
At some point in the mid 2000s Drum n Bass DJs started playing Dubstep songs in their sets. It was just a track or two, maybe at peak hour, as a break against the 160 bpm monotony that drove a lot of Dnb in those days.
People really liked the change of pace. Dubstep was like the ballad genre of DnB. Because it was so distinctive sounding people appreciated it more and the rewind-conscious DJs over time began incorporating more Dubstep tracks in their sets until Dubstep took over DnB sets entirely. DnB Producers recognized the way these winds were blowing and decided to just put Dubstep drops straight into their DnB cuts, and a new fusion genre was born.
Drumstep is an extension of the Pendulum sound, especially since Pendulum has made some of it. But characteristic of most Drumstep is that most tracks are often split in two, with one half being a more "DnB" like sound and the other half being a more "Dubstep" sound. As if all that variety somehow makes the song better. It's like putting both country and western influences in your soft rock song.
Drumstep is also a genre that largely exists through remixes (one of the hallmark signatures of a trendwhore genre). No one actually sets out to make a Drumstep track, but invariably at some point a Drum n Bass producer will like a Dubstep drop enough to go "this needs a Pendulum kick" or a Dubstep producer will listen to a shitty Liquid Funk vocal track and think "I know a way to make this even shittier!" And that's how Drumstep survives: As the b-side leftovers of dumbass cross-genre remixers.
This is not Drumstep's fault. Everything was "Dubstep" in the late 2000s so it was hard for DnB to ignore such an immense influence. Drumstep still exists but it's hard to distinguish it now since it has been folded into whatever the post-Dubstep people are calling post-Dubstep these days.
Ish.


## Darkstep
*aka:  Hardstep* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in late 90s

Darkstep (not to be confused with Darkside) takes Techstep and adds the rolling basslines of Darkside to it, often distorted and overdriven to give the bass a growling, gritty sandpaper feel.
While the infamous "rolling bass" sound of DnB was made famous by this genre, it actually has its partial origins in Darkside and its real origins in something that predates Drum n Bass entirely. Allow me to explain:
In 1988 Techno pioneer Kevin Saunderson under his Reese alias released a track called Just Want Another Chance. The bassline for this track was low and distinctive and rumbling without being harsh or gritty. It had a smooth sinusoidal whole note quality to it, like a big bowling ball rolling down an infinite alley that occasionally changes in angle of declination.
The sound was so popular that it became known as the "Reese" bass for awhile. Producers over the years have replicated it many times over with many different machines, but the original (according to Kevin himself) was actually produced on a Casio CZ-5000.
What a Casio CZ-5000 might look like
It didn't hurt that the B-side of the record had the bass sound sans any accompaniment as a battle tool, making it rife for sampling, but Drum n Bass producers didn't pick up on it until the post-Amen period (ie: 1994ish). And when they did, instead of sampling the shit out of it like the amen break, they grabbed their own gear to reproduce their own Reese basslines. In a pinch a Roland Juno 106 will do -- or any subtractive synthesis for those of you who work with hardware. For those of you who don't: Get some hardware.
Grooverider, Dillinja and Ray Keith were probably the first producers to sample and/or recreate the Reese bass, and their success re-christened the sound the DnB "rolling bassline": The audio technique that launched a million rewinds.
Darkstep's contribution to this contribution was to dirty up the bassline so instead of a bowling ball going down an alley it was more like a bowling ball going down an alley full of gravel. In combination with the rise of Nu Skool Breaks one scene over, Darkstep faced fierce competition over who could create the dirtiest, nastiest, and most massively outright evil basslines in the scene, led by Dieselboy, a DJ who's name is so appropriate for this genre I haven't thought of a clever remark yet.
From Ishkur's classic captions
Outside of the rolling bassline, another curious attribute of Darkstep is what I like to call "spoon percussion". If you listen closely to the drum programming on a lot of Darkstep tracks, you'll hear a tinny rattling in the background, like someone shaking an empty water bottle with rocks in it. It's probably just sped up bongo samples but I like to think that it's Artis the Spoonman from Soundgarden on every track, just going to town on his spoons. Rock on, Spoonman.
Darkstep is a name that has been hi-jacked in recent years by the descendents of Brostep to further their own pathetic attempt at whatever they think they're doing that constitutes music. Because the name 'Brostep' has been sullied, they have taken to calling it Darkstep instead, because all music genres need new names after a few years, like McDonald's advertising campaigns. This is wrong, by the way. Don't ever do this.
Today Darkstep, Neurofunk, and their derivatives remain the last bastion of rinsed-out propah undahground Drum n Bass since Jumpup mutated into cheesy pop Pendulum bollocks and Liquid Funk debased itself with cheesy Vocal Trance shite.

Darkstep's last stand against the evil forces of bubblegum commercialism.... fighting the mainstream, forever.(Rawthang - Beautiful Morning)
	

This scene was seriously better before all the white people started liking it.

## Neurofunk
*aka:  Electrostep, Psybreaks, Psychedelic Breaks* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in late 90s

Drum n Bass has more than its share of dark and menacing genres. Neurofunk is downright dystopian.
The gas mask is essential for when the cops tear gas the place.
When you have a musical artform as massive as electronic music, its inevitable that people within it will mix and match various genres like pickles and peanut butter hoping to produce viable offspring, like Trance with Jazz, Acid with Jungle, Breaks with Moog, Hip Hop with Goth, Bass with Synthpop, and so on. Just to see what works and what doesn't.
This is why it's not altogether appropriate to design these music guide maps like biological evolution. Life only descends from its parents, it can't go backwards and it can't go sideways (otherwise we'd all have wings). It can only evolve into something descended from itself.
Music doesn't behave like life. It can go forward, backward, sideways, and it is free to steal any and all ideas it wants from any other genre it wants, either living or dead, from any time period or culture. It is not restricted to just the most recent common ancestor -- it will mix Zydeco with Minimal Tech if it wants.
If music were biological life, it would more closely resemble the mythological frankencreatures of the Greeks and Babylonians that have the head of a man, the body of a lion, the wings of an eagle, the fangs of a snake, the tail of a scorpion, and the butt of a Kardashian.
(Also, lazarus taxonomies are everywhere in music. Just because a genre died back in the 80s doesn't mean it can't be resurrected sometime in the future)
Skulls are also essential as a place to store human brains.
So it was inevitable that someone eventually got around to mixing Industrial with Drum n Bass, complete with gothic/rivethead clothing, steampunk engineering, horror art and imagery, fascist politics, and post-apocalyptic prophecies. We were already halfway there with Techstep and Darkstep anyway.
Neurofunk started off in the late 90s with more Electro influnces -- space effects, sci-fi samples, computer sounds, vocoders, eery atmospheric soundscapes and the like. But through the process of natural selection it eventually evolved into something that could withstand the harsh environment of a DnB show.
This is one of the few Drum n Bass genres to still employ inventive drum programming, neither relying on the two-step kick nor the amen break all that much. Originally it eschewed the rolling bassline because there's far more going on in Neurofunk than just big-ass bass anthems. Of course, that didn't stop some whores from creating a dirty, filthy, grimy, heavy bass-driven form of it anyway, called Neurobass.
Because god forbid people just can't enjoy listening to music, they've got to feel it churn their stomach acid as well. Come on, people. Not every damn genre needs a glass-shattering wall of bass. Expand your horizons a little.
Jesus fucking Christ I want to enjoy the music, not get murdered by it.
Neurofunk is also one of the few Drum n Bass genres that don't come entirely from the UK. It has healthy contributors in the United States and Australia, helping to bring the Drum n Bass scene worldwide where for the first decade of its existence it was very much an insular UK thing.
If you consider yourself a true underground Junglist, this is probably where you are today. Because lord knows you don't have the stomach for that candy-coated Liquid Funk nonsense nor the overdriven blaring anthems of the commercial Pendulum garbage. There's really nowhere else for you to go.
But hey, no music truly dies, so maybe we're due for a Ragga Jungle revival. Any day now.
Ish. 


## Techstep
*aka:  Hardstep* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 90s

According to legend, Techstep is the first Jungle genre to actually be Drum n Bass. But it's not the genre that made the most of it.
As the name implies, Techstep is the merging of Drum n Bass with Techno esthetics, which means mechanicalism, industrial sounds, tweets and zapps and other artificial  instrumentation characteristic of Techno. So no sampled breakbeats here; the drums are all machine programmed and tend to have a minimalist gloss with heavy kicks and an atmospheric sense of anxiety and paranoia.
Some Techstep uses the two-step kick but a lot of it actually uses a modified version of the two-step called the domen break, after Dom & Roland who supposedly came up with it as a sound engineer for DJ Trace's remix of Mutant Jazz. Looks like this on a drum sequencer:
There is more percussion than just this, of course. This just illustrates where the kicks and snares are in relation to each other.(incidentally this is very close to the first bar of the Numbers break which has the second snare on 13 instead of 12)
While Techstep is hard and dark, it is not evil (that would come later with Darkstep). It is the polar opposite of Jazzstep, which preferred acoustic instruments and organic human voices.
Techstep is processed, synthetic, and repetitive -- just like Techno. Even the basslines are abrasive and sawtoothy, giving the genre a raw, buzzing edge. At the time it served a welcome niche for junglists who disliked the organic acoustics of Jazzstep and the mainstream popularity of Jumpup. Here they could stay comfortably in the underground listening to the Drum n Bass that those other poseur junglists didn't listen to. Elitism is a very important thing in the Drum n Bass scene.
A fun nickname for this genre was "Beehive DnB" (or Mosquito -- for instance, Jonny L - Piper (Grooverider mix)), for its frequent use of buzzing synths which sound like the room is being invaded by an army of giant dogs with bees in their mouths and when they bark they shoot bees at you.
Just about every genre in Drum n Bass is made famous not by its inventor, but by the exploiters of the invention. It's not certain who came up with or even coined Techstep, but the producers who caned it the most and became the most famed for it was Ed Rush who liked to smoke so much ganja that he would start to hallucinate, and that would put him in the right frame of mind to cut a gloomy Techstep track.
This is around the point in the mid 90s where the terms "Jungle" and "Drum n Bass" began to be used interchangeably, or even concatenated as "Jungle Drum n Bass" or JDB. The confusion may stem from its haphazard use in a lot of compilations and mixes, as marketers slowly phased out the old term and ushered in the new:
From this compilation series. Well which is it? Are they Jungle anthems or is it a selection of Drum n Bass tunee?
Techstep is probably still around but it's really playing third fiddle to its descendents Darkstep and Neurofunk which brought growling basslines and sci-fi/Electro themes that were much more well received.
Ish.


## Microfunk
*aka:  Minimal Drum n Bass, Minimal Jungle* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 00s

Microfunk is a trendwhore genre.
Just as Techstep is Techno + Drum n Bass and Neurofunk is Industrial + Drum n Bass, Microfunk is Tech House + Drum n Bass. And not just any Tech House, but the Microhouse/Minimal Tech monotony that dominated German clubs for an entire decade in the 00s.
I've often said that genres are influenced by their contemporaries far more than they are by their parents, and in the 2000s it was hard to ignore the immense impact that plinky plonky Minimal Tech music had on other scenes.
Trendwhoring has been known to occur with many classic tracks and even some producers, and here is an instance of it occurring in an entire genre. This is literally Minimal Drum n Bass, which is the exact opposite aesthetic that Drum n Bass is always striving for. It's like adding ranch and blue cheese dressing to spice up your chicken sandwich.
But who is this genre meant for? It doesn't really appeal to anyone. Junglists do not want angel hair thin drum kicks and Berliner plinky plonk, and the Germans just aren't going to accept two-step drum kicks. I mean it sounds fine but it just seems off, like those youtube instructional videos that are really useful but then the guy will let slip something racist or conspiratorial.
"Hi folks -- today I'm going to teach you how to peel a potato perfectly in less than 10 seconds. This skill will prepare you for when the global economy collapses at the hands of the Jews and the lizard people emerge from their ten thousand year slumber to take over the world."
So in an attempt at a fusion of both scenes this music succeeds in appealing to neither of them. Those parties must have felt more awkward than a room full of autistics trying to high five.
Microfunk, incidentally, is also the name of a defunkt software company in the 70s that made the MOS-DOS or Mothership Operating System, a command prompt interface that dropped da bomb and tore the roof off the sucka nerds trying to funkasize their input queries.
The good news is Microfunk did not last long (or if it did, not very prominantly), as Dubstep was just around the corner and that is a much happier relationship than Tech House.
Those who attempted to make Microfunk were swept up in the Dubstep + Drum n Bass trendwhore genre Drumstep as soon as it was temporally prudent to do so, and Microfunk remains a small side genre that might still exist but probably doesn't, a pet project of the Autonomic roster for the most part.
If there is Microfunk today, it probably sounds indistinguishable from Drumstep now.
Ish. 


## Darkside
*aka:  Jungle, Darkcore, Dark Hardcore, Hardcore Jungle, Jungle Techno, Hardstep* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in early 90s

Darkside Jungle is Ragga Jungle without the Ragga.
Both genres came from Oldskool Rave Hardcore, but where Ragga Jungle simply rejected the childish popularity of Rave, Darkside aggressively despised it. It created a new class of partygoer -- the junglist -- to actively oppose the infantilism infecting raves. This schism -- junglists vs candykids -- still exists today. Dance party relations have never fully healed and probably never will, like Protestants and Catholics.
Happy Hardcore was raging across England during this time so whatever cutesy thing the ravers were doing, the junglists did the exact opposite. The ravers danced to uplifting piano fills, the junglists danced to growling basslines. The ravers dressed in brightly colored clothes, the junglists decked themselves in comoflage. The ravers liked samples from children's television shows, the junglists liked samples from war, like gun shots and air raid sirens. It is a polar opposite extremity of party lifestyles, values, and philosophy.
The classic junglist tropes were developed here: Military motifs and fatigues, dark lighting, white people with dredlocks, denim jeans and hoodies and baseball caps, and camo everything (especially cargo pants).
Like this but with more attitude.
Junglists like to carry an "underdog" chip on their shoulder wherever they go. Throughout the 90s their stage at the massive was always the smallest (usually a tent or inconspicuous roped off area far from the soaring uplifting anthems of the main stage), and they have always scoffed at the way they are repeatedly snubbed in house and trance-centric magazines and Dutch horseshit popularity contests.
This makes Junglists more fanatical and devoted to their scene and unwilling to mingle with other scenes, like a cult or weird online forum devoted to crank conspiracy theories. They revel in their individuality, how they are special and different than everyone else, listening to this awesome dark underground music that you've never heard of. And they want things to stay that way.
Darkside was originally called Darkcore or Dark Hardcore or Dark Jungle or Dark' or Darkness Is Spreading or whatever as long as it had the name Dark in it. Its themes of the occult and its focus on the consequences of drug use rather than the euphoria separated it from other parties. Because no one smiles at a Jungle party. They're not supposed to.
Not a junglist. You can tell by the smile.
The artists and labels of Jungle have names like MC Renegade Assassin Terrorist Gasmask 187 or DJ Sniper Combat Assault Rifle Camo Khakis or AK Full Metal Army Bass Revolution Movement Recordings. If you want to get into Jungle and you're struggling for a name, simply mix military and reggae euphemisms like "dubplate", "science", "Babylon", And change any word that ends in "er" to "ah" because they don't pronounce the end of words in England and you want to sound legit.
There is a subgenre of Darkside called Hardstep which emerged in 94 and emphasized the drum kicks in the amen break as opposed to the rat-a-tat snares. Or it may have been something of a marketing push by Goldie, who knows. Producers come up with new names for their sound all the time, if only to claim that it's different than everyone else's sound. But the curators of this Hardstep sound went on to call it Techstep and Darkstep instead. Because sometimes the marketing doesn't work.
Like Ragga Jungle, Darkside was phased out by the end of the 90s along with the amen break and the name Jungle. The scene fragmented after 94 and those who wanted to continue making growling and/or evil-sounding music moved on to Darkstep, and those who had gotten sick of the menacing basslines and wanted to serve up something sophisticated and mature for upscale clientele rather than face-mashing meth music moved onto Jazzstep.
And for those who recognized the commercial potential of the two-step drum break, there was Jumpup -- the beginning of the end for a scene of music that prides itself on staying underground.
Ish.



## Liquid Funk
*aka:  Liquid Jungle, Liquid Drum n Bass, Vocal Drum n Bass, Melodic Drum n Bass, Disco n Bass, Dancefloor* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in early 00s

Liquid Funk is Jazzstep v2.0, this time as a form of Drum n Bass incorporating other elements like Funk, Disco, R&B, Soul, and even Deep House which initially was a keen idea. Nothing wrong with borrowing some contemporary influences. The late 90s was a great time to be an electronic music fan and Liquid Funk was a welcome addition to the cultural zeitgeist.
Just before the turn of the millenium is when a sufficient number of white people were attending Jungle parties to the point where music writers and magazines stopped calling it Jungle and rebranded it Drum n Bass, although the partykids retained the label "junglists" and they're still called that today (probably because "drumnbassists" isn't as catchy).
Not coincidentally this is also the point where the two-step drum kick takes over everything, ushering in an age of mediocrity for a scene that was once specifically noted for its unique and inventive drum programming. You might as well call this Disco n Bass.
As if things couldn't get any worse for Disco n Bass, the lucrative opportunity of mad festival money in the 2010s compelled it to whore itself into a subgenre depository of shitty pop remixes heretofore known as Dancefloor. If you hear a Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift or even Adele remix with a powerful Pendulum two-step drum kick, it's technically Dancefloor: The end game of pop music trendwhore oblivion.

Nothing crystalized the Pendulum-ization of Liquid Funk into Dancefloor more than Sigma - Nobody To Love. It's just awful in all the ways a trendwhored track can be. This is Drum n Bass the way Avril Lavigne is Punk. Though I'm sure Charlie Wilson enjoys the residuals.
	

If you are a junglist and you like to pride yourself on liking a form of music that hasn't whored itself out to pop songcraft like Eurotrance, you actually have no argument here. With Pendulum you have your Anthem House, and with Liquid Funk/Dancefloor you have your Vocal Trance -- the worst excesses of cheesy, sacharine schmaltz in electronic music.
The final nail in your underground cred was Tiesto working with High Contrast to make a shitty pop dnb record that is awful for all the reasons pop music is awful.
Pop music is not a genre but a process. The goal of pop is to water down and smooth out music, making it palatable for grandmothers and 8-year-olds so say goodbye to crazy rat-a-tat amen breaks and say hello to family-friendly two-step kicks. Also the employment of verses, bridges, choruses, hooks and vocals -- the staples of 3-minute commercial radio marketing.
Any genre of music can become pop if it's given the shiny, plastic, polished sheen of simple tinker toys. Everything from Rap, to Rock, to Punk, to R&B, to Jazz, to Techno has become pop music at one time or another. Your favorite genre is not immune.
The purpose of pop music is not to evoke emotion or to have any lasting appeal, it is to sell the most music to the most possible numbers of people. It is essentially fast food -- something people do not value the inherent quality of but seek instantaneous and short-term sustenance.
Nearly every genre of music betrays its ethos when it becomes pop. And once it is pop, it is very hard for its previous underground essence to persist. Nowhere is this more evocative than the transmogrification of Liquid Funk into Dancefloor, from something jazzy and earnest and soulful into something more tragic than the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic.
If you're wondering what's so bad about this, understand that this always attracts a new generation of fans who aren't actual fans of the genre but rather the shiny, featherlite, singalong, kiddie gloves, cheddar cheese, sanitized version of the genre, the sonic equivalent of a baby proofed bathroom which in most cases is a complete betrayal and is devoid of any depth, worth or meaning. Dancefloor is soulless, bland, paint-by-numbers schlock.
And before you think that maybe this is a good thing and Liquid Funk can be the gateway genre easing the punters into looking deeper and finding the real genuine underground Jungle, you're fucking naive not to mention wrong. The people didn't come to this music because they like Jungle, they came to this music because it's crappy pop.
People who like crap will always like crap and will continue to like crap, in whatever form it takes. They jump from crap to crap to crap through disparate scenes, consuming the mass produced shallow version of it like locusts. Crap is never a gateway to quality. When they get tired of this crap, they just move on to the next crap thing. This applies to everything in consumable media: Music, television, movies, etc.
If you like this music, just admit it to yourself: You don't actually like Drum n Bass. You like crap.
Ish.



## Jazzstep
*aka:  Jazzy Jungle, Jazzy DnB, Jazz n Bass, Sambastep, Latinstep* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 90s

Jazzstep is the logical progression (pun intended) of Atmospheric Jungle into something for the 4-star restaurant and swanky smooth jazz crowd.
If Atmospheric Jungle is for older more mature folks, then Jazzstep is for folks even older and more mature than that. You might even call it Dadstep. No, not like "Son, back in 68 I crawled into a foxhole and killed two VCs with just my toothbrush -- you have my little girl home by 10" Dadstep, more like "I've got an original Billie Holiday And Her Orchestra - No Regrets on 78 that I never play because I don't want to wear it out" Dadstep. There is a metaphor in there somewhere.
Okay, so I googled Jazzstep and this is honestly what came up.
It wasn't long before producers realized that these spastic double-time breakbeats can have soul, complete with real sultry vocalists crooning over top real backing bands playing real sounds on real instruments. Really.
Or at least samples of them.
Some Jazzstep is technically not electronic at all. A good example is Roni Size & Reprazent, a live band that has no actual electronic instruments (the bass is an untreated double bass guitar complete with the squeaky sound of fingers sliding over strings), but replicates the Jazzstep sound to the point of perfection. Herbie Hancock should have been all over this (unless he already was 50 years ago and no one noticed).
Due to its cross-over appeal and radio friendly vibe it was common for diva-laced Jazzstep tracks to chart in the mainstream and blow up all over indie movies and car commercials which means everyone had to listen to endless rewinds of them every night at the club for a few weekends. I remember this happened with a Janet Jackson remix back in the day. Four times in a row at the same club.
It also happened with Olive - You're Not Alone, EZ Rollers - Tough At The Top, and of course Cleveland Lounge - Drowning, and because people like cheesy singalong melodies that they can karoake into a tennis racket or hair curlers in their room while getting ready to go out, eventually this phenomenon became an actual genre -- Liquid Funk.
Jazzstep is noted for its use of brass instrumentation, so there are subgenres like Sambastep and Latinstep that invoke influences of everything from bossa nova rhythms to blaring mariachi horns. And this is just speculation on my part but there's probably also a subgenre called 80step, which is full of sexy saxophone riffs and bombastic Tina Turner power vocals who was only popular in the 80s because her voice sounds like a saxophone.
No one can withstand the raw sexual magnetism of 80s saxophones.
Jazzstep also has flutes! You're not going to hear flutes --- or any woodwinds for that matter -- in other electronic music genres, so enjoy them here while you can. Jazzstep is truly the Jethro Tull of electronic music.
Jazzstep is still around today (because jazz never goes out of style), but in a diminutive form due to the overwhelming popularity of its successor: Liquid Funk.
Ish.



## Atmospheric Jungle
*aka:  Atmospheric Drum n Bass, Ambient Jungle, Ambient Drum n Bass, Dolphin Jungle, Intelligent Jungle, Intelligent Drum n Bass, Artcore* in the Drum n Bass scene, emerged in mid 90s

Atmospheric Jungle is Ambient applied to Jungle. An early name for it was Artcore but no one called it that except the people who were into it before it became a thing and even they weren't sure what they were listening to half the time.
It also tries to get balearic at times, incorporating crashing waves, seagull cries and whale calls, earning it the pejorative (is it a pejorative? I think it's a pejorative) "Dolphin Jungle".
No not those Dolphins.
Every scene has its "ballad" genre, even one as aggressive and menacing as Drum n Bass. In much the same way 80s metal bands had that one slow song on the album that crossed over into prom hit territory, every electronic music scene nurses that one mellow and chill genre for all the tired partykids to rest at 5am after dancing for 6 hours.
And this genre is never treated like the sappy loser of the scene like that one kid in gym class who can't do a single pull up, but rather as an important work of art, as if it's a demonstration to the normals that there is more to this music than just dancing all night hopped up on goofballs. There's also sitting in a comfortable chesterfield and listening to it while hopped up on goofballs.
Some have even insisted that it is a mark of maturity, growth, and chinstroking forward-thinkingness to like this music. Or maybe it's just for thirtysomethings who like dnb but don't want to hang around with teenagers on weekends.
Atmospheric Jungle goes with Dub Techno, 2-Step Garage, Deeptech, Progressive Breaks, Psydub and other types of mellow, non-dance genres in its tendency to attract poseurs and hipsters. That's no reason to not like it, but it is a reason to not like other people who like it, if bitter and jaded is your thing.
These dolphins.
Because it is aimed at an older more mature crowd, naturally it is going to find its way into the older more mature things that older more mature people are into, like older more mature car commercials, older more mature cafes and lounges, and the occasional older more mature indie movie about a brooding, sensitive, artistic young male lead who loses his girlfriend in a tragic boating accident.
Few genres can be confidently asserted as being due almost entirely to one artist or label. Atmospheric Jungle is one of those genres. The artist is LTJ Bukem and his label is Good Looking Records (and its subsidiaries: Looking Good Records, Looks Good Records, Good Looks Records, and Looks Good Looking Gooding Records).
LTJ Bukem is not everything that exists in this genre (he's not even the one who invented it -- that credit belongs to Omni Trio or Origin Unknown depending on how badly you want to win this argument), but it's hard to take a trip through Atmospheric Jungle without bumping into him.

Listen to The Ultimate Atmospheric Jungle Mix. Difficulty: No LTJ Bukem.
	

The success of Atmospheric Jungle meant a whole lot of other things could be done with jungle's sped-up breakbeats, most of it very interesting because fusion genres are always fun, unless they turn out to be completely wrong like a peanut butter and pickle sandwich. But juxtopositions seem to work well in electronic music. Don't ask me why.
Ish.

# Hardcore

## Oldskool Rave Hardcore
*aka:  Breakbeat Hardcore, Rave, Hardcore Rave, Rave Hardcore, Hardrave, Hard Ravecore, Corehard Ravecore Rave Hard Core Hard Rave, Never Dying* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in early 90s

Oldskool Rave Hardcore was, at the time, called Rave Hardcore or Hardcore Rave or just Rave. It has since adopted the "oldskool" appellation to differentiate it from the two other genres also called Rave or Hardcore or Rave Hardcore or Hardcore Rave and both of them also just as oldskool. It's confusing, I know.
This was one of the catalysts for the creation of a formal governing body -- The Electronic Music Genre and Classifications Consortium -- to set down a standard and clarify all the clutter.
Party people back then did not really distinguish between the three genres. To them it was all Rave music. But since all three went in different directions crafting whole scenes in their wake, we like to separate them for the benefit of hindsight and historiography.
So I just want to make this clear: The three genres of Rave, Hardcore, and Oldskool Rave Hardcore is a modern demarcation only, much like how we call the Eastern Roman Empire the Byzantine Empire when no one who lived back then called it that (to them, it was still just the Roman Empire). This is a really geeky reference.
The electronic music scene was exploding with creativity in the early 90s. There was no such thing as an idea too weird (well maybe Glitch but that's not far off) and no radical experiment met a dead end. Almost anything is listenable if you do enough drugs.
So before long someone got the idea of taking hoover-charged Rave music and eschewing the 4-to-the-floor kickdrum in favor of breakbeats. Who was that person? I have no idea, but it wasn't The Prodigy. They didn't invent the genre, they only popularized it. But how did such a person come up with so many zany ideas in music? Probably because they were using a Roland W-30 workstation.
What a W-30 might look like.
Released in 1989, the W-30 was a sampler/sequencer with a disk drive and all the output ports that necessitate a workstation. As a Roland device it also had access to the entire library of Roland samples, effects, and native sounds, most of which became stock effects in Oldskool Rave Hardcore including cheering crowds, air raid sirens, and the omnipresent rave lead. It's also not a complete coincidence that Liam Howlett used a W-30 in Prodigy live shows as late as 2008.

Breakbeats gave Rave a Hip Hop flavor so it didn't take long before people began adding Rap-style call-and-response samples. And then someone else decided it also needed Italo House-style piano fills because why not? And while we're at it, let's speed the whole thing up to 160 BPM so the breakbeats are rapid fire, the samples sound like chipmunks and the piano fills are scrambly and uplifting. Think that won't work for a genre? Clearly you underestimate the 90s raver's voracious appetite for novelty, and the Rave producer's understanding that all of this was procured from one machine.
At least it should have been a novelty. Pitching vocals to chipmunk levels has been done to music since Ross Bagdasarian won two Grammys with the technique back in the 1950s. But the breakbeats were unique and custom, and the leads were varied and anthemic. And the pianos were new. 
Okay so the genre was full of gimmicks but they were interesting gimmicks, and each song sounded fresh and different while still adhering to the same basic recipe (oh my god, I'm starting to sound like Stephen Thomas Erlewine, aren't I? Please kill me).
As with most things in music, the wild, spontaneous creativity of Oldskool Rave Hardcore lasted only a year or two, dominated by a few monster hits that attracted a wave of also-rans, and before long everyone was making music that sounded like each other. That happens when you're all relying on the same sample library: Something goes from creative and original to tiring and burnt out in the span of two years.
The genre began to split in 1993 into two opposing sides, both fascinating but for different reasons. One side became infatuated with infantilism, sampling children's television shows like Prodigy - Charly, Acen - Trip II the Moon and Smart E's - Sesame's Treet, laying the seeds for what would eventually become Happy Hardcore.
The other side discovered something wonderful that rinsed out the unique and creative breakbeat drum patterns completely from the genre: The Amen Break. By focusing on this one thing to the exclusion of quite literally everything else, and also forming a Hegelian backlash against the corny infantilism infecting the genre, producers broke away to form their own scene: Jungle.
After this point, things are no longer united. Raves split into separate niches. And electronic music gets very complicated.
If you can believe it Oldskool Rave Hardcore still exists today, albeit as occasional one-off "hey remember Oldskool Rave Hardcore" tracks. It doesn't necessarily function as a scene anymore unless you can find a retro party or clubnight willing to play all the classics.
Ish.



## Happy Hardcore
*aka:  Bouncey Techno, Happy Gabber, Toytown* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in mid 90s

Happy Hardcore is Oldskool Rave Hardcore keeping the childlike silliness but re-instituting the distorted 909 kickdrum after seeing what Gabber had done with it which was a smart move.
It was very popular all over the world in the mid to late 90s which is pretty amazing considering the entire genre only ever had about a dozen dedicated UK producers (and some miscellaneous Dutch and German ones here and there).
These producers under countless aliases churned out Happy Hardcore at such a feverish pace you'd think there was an assembly line or template that they used to expedite the process. Well, there probably was since they liked to re-use the same drum kicks, leads, and breakdowns. And the same vocalists (there's only like four of them).
Happy Hardcore is irresistable at first glance, but like the sweet, syrupy, sticky molasses it peddles you begin to get sick of it after awhile. There is still some fun in the chaotic revelry of the early Happy Hardcore sound, but once it settled into a template (around 97 or so), things got pretty cheesy and formulaic.
A good timestamp of the entire genre is Anabolic Frolic's Happy2bHardcore compilation series released on that lone standard bearer of underground yet commercial American electronic music labels in the 90s: Moonshine.
Collect 'em all!
There are eight of them (depending on who you ask), released from 1997 to 2007 (long after Happy Hardcore stopped being Happy). They aren't terribly well mixed (Frolic was never a good DJ, especially live), but each one is an accurate snapshot of the year's biggest hits, like a pressed digital time capsule of whatever gave the candy ravers happy hardons at Toronto's legendary Hullabaloo parties.
Oh right. Candy ravers (or if you prefer: kandi kids). I should probably talk about them.
Yes, Happy Hardcore is the genre that gave us the iconic candy raver -- the pigtailed, funfur covered, rainbow colored, visor-hatted, phat pants-wearing, PLUR-chanting, whistle-blowing, pacifier-sucking, oodles of bracelets-wearing, candy munching, glitter dust sprinkling, stuffed animal backpack wearing, Vicks inhaling, glowstick shaking, baby T-shirt adorned with either cartoon characters or drug reference wearing, classic "raver" trope.
Sometimes they overdo it a bit.
In truth there were many raver tropes in the 90s but it was the candy ravers who are most remembered, in much the same way people only remember togas when they think of Ancient Greek fashion.
Despite being a culture of loopy twerps and Manic Pixie Dream Girls with infamously horrendous looking Geocities websites, candy ravers were remarkably sharp and well-organized (they had to be in order to keep track of all their candy and flair and stuffed animals). One particular scene was South California candy ravers, running a sickeningly corny ubb website called iloveraving.com which I routinely terrorized on a regular basis back in the day.
Who knows when it first started but somewhere around the mid 90s some SoCal candy ravers organized a get-together day at Disneyland. The response was overwhelming and they invaded the park in the tens of thousands decked out in complete candy gear and probably scaring the tourists (or convincing them that they're part of the entertainment).
One thing that's disappeared over the years are the phat pants.
Disneyland took note of the invasion and -- recognizing that candy raving is synonymous with the park's childlike innocence and sense of wonder -- organized an annual "Raver Day" and hired DJs and sound crews to throw a daylong party for the raving faithful (Disneyland doesn't do this anymore, mostly because there are more special events at Disneyland now than there are days on the calendar: Ska Day, Gay Day, Star Wars Day, Harry Potter Day, Nerd Day, Goth Day, etc. But Raver Day still happens).
The genuine candy raver look hasn't changed much in 20 years, but lately it seems to have evolved into a more outrageous raver type that blends emo, cybergoth, and 80s sleazy glam, complete with expensive furry boots, hair streamers and wigs, cheap neon sunglasses, streaked hair and fishnets. But they kept the oodles of bracelets.
They got a lot sluttier, too.
I would like to point out that classic candy ravers usually made their own clothes, including the phat pants (I have done this -- you're not a real raver unless you make your own pants). Today's glam ravers probably buy their clothes at RebelsMarket making them poseurs by default. Real culture isn't something you purchase, it is something you create.
But I shouldn't judge. These kids were the life of the party back in the day and still are to some extent. They are several orders of magnitude higher and more noble than the filthy dregs that prowl today's parties:
Who are these motherfuckers and why didn't they stay at the Papa Roach concert where they belong?
It's not entirely fair to say that Happy Hardcore wore out its welcome by the end of the 90s, but it did appear like the producers were growing tired of the cutesy melodies and singalong choruses just as much as the candy ravers were, so a change in direction was needed. They noticed that NRG was stealing a lot of their jibtek clientele at the time so they came up with a Hardcore version of it called Freeform.

Journey through the history of Happy Hardcore's evolution
	

Happy Hardcore is not around anymore, but unlike biological life musical taxonomies don't really go extinct. That means it is very resurrectable if someone is willing to take a chance on making some retro nostalgia Happy Hardcore today (Come on, Scott Brown -- you know you wanna). And why not? Everyone else in electronic music already has.
Ish.


## Freeform
*aka:  Trancecore, Acidcore* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in late 90s

Freeform is a transition genre between Happy Hardcore and UK Hardcore. Not to be confused with Freeform Jazz.
It's all about the candy you don't wear.
It's called Freeform because no one really knew what to call it at the time. Evidently some producers (actually the same producers) decided that they were tired of the loveable singalong melodies and infantilism of Happy Hardcore, possibly because they grew up or possibly because the music really does get annoying after awhile. So they evolved their output into something more mature. A harder-edged aggressive sound with NRG stabs and Hard Acid 303 squeals and Eurotrance supersaws. It is very contemporary.
Without the cutesy lyrics and nursery rhyme melodies could it really be called Happy Hardcore anymore? What was happy about it? Clearly a new name was needed for this suave and sophisticated brand of candy raver silliness but what to call it?
Freeform.
They called it fucking Freeform which doesn't really mean anything. I'm sure it was just a placeholder until something better came along which was UK Hardcore but man. It took them five years to come up with that. This scene seriously needs better marketing.
I mean, at least call it Freeformcore, amirite?
Happy Hardcore had become something of a pejorative in rave circles anyway, especially among those who think the point of electronic music is to look badass, and you can't look badass fistpumping to music about eternal love and fluffy teddy bears.
An earlier term for it was Trancecore because Trance was big at the time and then it suddenly wasn't (something of a recurring trend in electronic music), so the name had to be changed. No one wanted anything to do with Trance when the new millenium rolled around unless they were the sonically dense Dutch.
Freeform thus became the perfect name to describe something that they didn't want to describe or associate with anything else, not even its progenitor Happy Hardcore, which is both illogical and counter-productive, like making a hard boiled egg by sous vide for 8 hours.
The candy ravers followed suit because what else are candy ravers going to do in this era? They are married to this line of progression on the guide.
According to synesthesiasts, Freeform is blue and green.
As previously mentioned, the happier areas of Hardcore are dangerously incestuous, and you really begin to see the same dozen names and aliases pile up in Freeform, with every song a colloboration or concatenation of names.
If I ever made a Hardcore track I would call it "Brisk & Bang! & Gammer & Force & Dougal & Ham & Energy vs Styles & Frisky & Storm & Hixxy & Sy & Breeze & Sharkey Feat. Jo James & Jenka & Jenna & Whoever That Chick Who Sings With DJ Stompy Is - Everybody's On This (Vinylgroover's What About Me Edit of Scott Brown's No More Collaborations mix)". That would be the choon to end all choons.
This was only supposed to be a stepping stone genre anyway so when the confusion settled in the mid-00s people took to calling this music and all its nicknames and derivatives UK Hardcore instead. So that's where you should go next.
Ish.



## UK Hardcore
*aka:  Power Stomp* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in early 00s

UK Hardcore is basically just sped up Eurotrance.
There is an order of progression that got us to this point. Happy Hardcore mostly came from Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Freeform mostly came from the Netherlands and the UK (the Germans buggered off to make Minimal Tech). And this -- UK Hardcore -- comes from the UK almost exclusively (the Dutch buggered off to make Hardstyle). So the one thing you can say about it is that it earns its label.
But the important point is that the number of countries subsidizing this music is getting smaller. That could be a bad thing but probably not considering one of the countries is the Netherlands.
Do today's kandi kids even like Hardcore?
It's still the same music, people just needed to call it something else because the newer generation takes music way too seriously so they don't want anything they like to be associated with the word "happy" (Happy Fun Ball stopped selling after 2000 for this reason). It still has cheesy vocals (sometimes), it still has uplifting melodies (occasionally), and it still has a 180 bpm kickdrum (sometimes faster), but gone are all the playful, childlike elements -- the pianos and nursery jingles and breakbeat samples.
This is a music scene that has grown up and as such can't really sing about the same things anymore since most of the producers are pushing 50. That's like Trent Reznor still being a whiny teenage angsty rebel well into his 40s. It's just sad.
Purists of course hate it. Newbs of course love it because it's their gateway into rave, but really this is just Happy Hardcore that takes itself too seriously. It is a typical pattern in electronic music that as a genre ages there is a tendency to make it harder and nastier, mostly because producers compete to have their track secure the coveted peak hour drug-maximizing spot. UK Hardcore is no different -- just another watermelon seed spitting contest in electronic music.
I mean it seems like some kan-- wait, is that Miley Cyrus? What kind of cultural appropriation bullshit is this? Take those bracelets off, Miley. You didn't earn them (and by earn I mean you traded for them with other kandi kids at a fucking Hardcore rave).
It's a good question to ask where it should go from here, because like Germany in 1945 it has run out of countries to retreat from. There are recent reports that UK Hardcore has trendwhored Trap to create a subgenre called Trapcore or Trappy Hardcore, which may be a thing a year or two from now, but let's wait until the dust settles first.
Ish.



## Hardcore
*aka:  Gabber, Gabba, Nu Style Gabber, Doomcore, Terrorcore, Metalcore, Deathcore* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in early 90s

Hardcore is Rave taken to another level. A more harder level. You might say a hard core level.
There is a logical progression to all this. Hardcore is a harder version of Rave, which was a harder version of Euro Techno, which was a harder version of Bleep Techno, which was a misunderstood interpretation of Detroit Techno. There may be other influences but that is the general gist.
This is how we got to this point -- everyone outdoing one another each week by coming out with something harder and more menacing, in much the same way The Beatles wanted to make a harder record than The Who so they came up with Helter Skelter. And then a year later Black Sabbath came out with Paranoid.
It's amazing that all of this is happened within the same year. While the Belgians abused the horn fanfares and hoovers, the Dutch focused on the beat, redlining the 909 kickdrum or feeding it through an effects processor or better yet a guitar distortion pedal, mutating it into a crunchy eldritch abomination of whatever a kick drum is supposed to sound like.
Hardcore was Rave evolving into its final form, like Tetsuo's grotesque transformation at the end of Akira. The rallying cry of 1992 was "Hardcore! U Know The Score!" Which was also a marketing catchphrase on every Hardcore compilation released at that time.
Of what? The last hockey game or something?
The result is Gabber or Gabba (Dutch for "mate"), laying out those crunchy 909 kicks at 180bpm which was too fast for Techno or even Hard Techno so they just took to calling it all Hardcore.
Naturally it attracted the most unsavory elements of humanity: Skinheads, football hooligans, gangs and louts and total edgelords with small penises who brag about headbutting broken glass. In all seriousness Hardcore isn't very manly. It's so hard it inverts into corny, like Pantera lyrics or punk band names that try to be shocking like Anal Cunt.
Always rely on the Dutch to take something to such a cartoonish extreme that it becomes a stupid parody of itself. Let it be known that the Dutch don't know the meaning of restraint.
The best way to appreciate Hardcore is to take the piss. Like this ad from the Midwest (I think it's the Midwest) from back when specialty record stores bought ads in newspapers with relaxed regulations.
Hardcore wasn't exclusively a dumb Dutch thing, but that was its epicenter. There were also vibrant scenes in New York and most importantly the Midwest, chiefly Milwaukee, where the Drop Bass Network proudly carried the banner for North American Hardcore. You can tell which Hardcore is American by the fact that it doesn't sound Dutch, and by Dutch I mean completely stupid.
Hardcore is headache music. It's great in small doses or when you have a lot of pent-up energy and just want to hop up and down (aka pogo dancing, the electronic music equivalent of headbanging), which is good for a peak hour set. But a whole night or weekend of it gets awfully boring.
If Hardcore has one claim to fame, it was the official soundtrack to the Internet's first mass meme in 2001 care of a Flash movie featuring the Laziest Men on Mars, a Something Awful photoshop contest that got out of control, and Zero Wing, a Sega Genesis game with hilarious engrish.

Technically it would be Plus, given that it's a Chiptune with a Gabber beat.
	

There are an immense number of Hardcore subgenres, so many that I think most of them are just made up: Doomcore, Evilcore, Horrorcore, Deathcore, Terrorcore, Analcore, Awfulcore, Shitecore, Corecore, Futurecore, Casiocore, Punkcore, Metalcore, Fartcore, Applecore, Marinecore, Gabbercore, and of course Nu Style Gabber.
Actually Nu Style Gabber is a thing. It came to prominance in the late 90s as a slower version of Gabber (160bpm instead of 180bpm) with even thicker, more distorted kickdrums. The drums were so thick they no longer went "THUNG THUNG THUNG THUNG!" but rather picked up a peculiar bouncey effect so they sounded more like "THOING THOING THOING THOING!" somehow making Hardcore sound even stupider than before. Again, blame the Dutch and their stubbon resilience to knowing when they've taken things too far. You want ice cream, they serve you a bowl of frozen sugar.
For a good one-stop shop for all your Dutch Gabbershite needs, try any one of the 185 Thunderdome compilations that have flooded the market like dick pics on Snapchat.
Nu Style Gabber has essentially dominated Hardcore ever since, only lately it has slowed to the point where it sounds indistinguishable from Hardstyle, effectively merging the genres which is fine because the same Dutch prodouchers make both and the same Dutch douchelords listen to both.
So there's almost no distinction anymore, both in the DJs who cane the crap at Sensation Black and the raging dorkmongers in attendance who think they're too good for Rob Gee.
Of course Hardcore is still around today. It'll never die. It even says so.
Ish.


## Speedcore
*aka:  Splittercore, Flashcore, Extratone, Speedbass* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in late 90s

Speedcore is, as the name implies, super fast Hardcore. Naming these genres ain't rocket surgery, folks.
Hardcore is already plenty fast, usually clipping around 180 bpm, so Speedcore would naturally have to be, like, even faster. The range for this varies but generally most tracks hover around 300 bpm.
But tracks can go -- and have gone -- much faster.
Who would want to listen to, much less dance to, something like this? Well, engineers and audiophiles initially. Speedcore was more of a novelty genre in the days when technology had limitations and music hardware could only play so fast. The goal was to take these machines apart, fiddle with the factory settings or even rip apart the circuitry to extend them well past their limitations. It was an electronic music hardware equivalent of overclocking and the community that did this got very competitive, stress testing drum machines the way computer nerds stress test CPUs or auto mechanics stress test RPMs.
This may all have been apocryphal, however, as I don't know anyone who actually participated in such a competition. And it's a moot slice of history since electronic music has no more limitations and you can make the beat as fast as you want these days and it wasn't even that hard back then. Moby made a 1000 bpm track back in 1993 so it wasn't like the genre had to wait for the technology to catch up with its vision.
The Speedcore community has denoted specific subgenres based on bpms that are organized like the layers of Earth's atmosphere:

Generally, anything 300 bpm and below is the tropospheric Hardcore we all live and breathe in. From 300 to 700 bpm is where the stratospheric Speedcore lies, which protects us with its ozone layer. From 700 bpm to 1000 bpm is a mesopheric subgenre known as Splittercore (where most partykids burn up in the atmosphere). Above 1000 bpm is a thermospheric subgenre known as Extratone. It is very pretty to look at the aurora borealis while listening to it. And finally, anything over 1500 bpm is no longer music and is white noise. Not to be confused with the Industrial genre Noise.
White noise is not a genre. Human ears cannot pick up individual drum kicks in anything that fast. The beats are no longer distinguishable so they just sound like a shower of rain hitting a tin roof. That's where we put our satellites.
At some point in the late 90s there was a small collective of Speedcore producers in San Francisco who called what they were making Speedbass, a genre that didn't really have any definition and was only called that because they made and released their music on their website, speedbass.net. The website no longer exists but the music still does and if I ever have the time I will go through them all someday. Mark my words: Speedbass will return!
As for Speedcore, it has always been a dick measuring contest between attention whores in the Hardcore scene (most Speedcore tracks are parodies or jokes). I'm not expecting you to like it or even listen to it. But you have to acknowledge that it's there. Humans have done this. They made this a thing.
For some reason.
Ish.
PS: I wrote this entry in 35 minutes. I guess you could say I... got through it really quickly. Like I was fast, in a rapid sort of way. I hastened my pace and rushed through it.


## Rave
*aka:  Techno Rave, Rave Techno, Hardcore Techno* in the Hardcore scene, emerged in early 90s

Rave was the zeitgeist of everything happening in the early 90s. It caused a generation of teenagers to collectively lose their shit and go "Shut Up And Dance" and it put a name to those crazy all-night drug fuelled dance-a-thons while causing a moral panic in both the USA and the UK.
The word "rave" actually predates the music. It had been in usage as early as 1988 in some places but when this charging, in-your-face sound became the dominant form of music it couldn't help but adopt the monicker of the parties themselves. It wasn't truly Hardcore, but it was Hardcore compared to what came before it.
You could argue that this is all because of the massive hit The KLF - What Time Is Love (Live At Trancentral), but in truth a sound this monstrous was inevitable. It could have happened without the KLF. It combined thumping Techno beats, sirens, whistles, lead vocals, charging guitars, gang shouting, vertigo-inducing strobe lights, go-go dancers, and of course the lovable hoover sound effect -- named after the vacuum cleaner -- that legend purports was found as a preset patch on the Roland Alpha Juno-1 synthesizer labeled "What the?!"
What a Roland Alpha Juno-1 might look like.
But most importantly: Rave gave us those delicious pop accessible singalong anthems that the mainstream could sink its teeth into.
After this point there was no going back. Electronic music became addicted to its own success and all popular electronic music thereafter relied on anthems for commercial appeal (some to excruciating excess).
This is the music of 2 Unlimited. This is the music of Mortal Kombat. This is the music of Don Cherry's Rock em Sock em Hockey vol 5 -- the Techno version. Yeah, this awesome slice of history:

Let's GO!
	

Rave anthems reflected the out-of-body zaniness of the outdoor rave experience. Not since Iron Maiden had any music caused an entire audience to enthusiastically go out of their minds and fist-pump in unison. It was audio pandemonium.
This is also the music that Henry Rollins infamously lambasted in one of his spoken word spectacles 15 years later, which is topical enough to be relevant to his audience in much the same way a comedian in the 80s complained about hippie Vietnam music.

Go ahead Henry, make fun of us. We'll just sample you and use it in a track (cf. Steve Porter. Yes, that Steve Porter).
	

Ironically, despite giving the world one of the most famous words in electronic music the genre itself was shortlived. No more than a year later Rave was subsumed by the newly christened Hardcore and Jungle scenes. Things moved so fast in the early 90s (even before the Internet) that genres barely lasted longer than a child's new Christmas toy before they were supplanted by the latest greatest thing. But in 1991 and 1992, this dominated everything. It was the one and only dominator. There was no other.
The absolute pinnacle of Rave is Psykosonik, a self-titled smash debut album that put everything that was happening in Belgium in the early 90s in one smoking package. This is an album that is equal parts EBM, New Beat, Rock, Rave, Techno, high pass filters on vocals and everything in between, and is utterly glorious for that stupid fact alone. You'll never find a better fusion album of an entire generation's zeitgeist. Watch and be amazed.

The visuals seem to be sending a statement to either Peter Gabriel or Bill Nye, I can't tell which.
	

As for Rave, too much was happening in the early 90s for sustainability. There were Hardcore and Jungle scenes to invent, and that is where it all went.
Ish.


# Techno

## Euro Techno
*aka:  Bleep Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in late 80s

Euro Techno is a valiant attempt by mainland Europe to make Bleep Techno.
Led mostly by Belgian New Beat producers who got tired of ripping off The KLF - What Time Is Love and decided instead to rip off The KLF - It's Grim Up North, Euro Techno was a faster paced, bleepy bunch of nonsense that introduced anthems and sirens and whistle noises to Techno.
Yeah, like that.
It would only be another year before producers would drop the Techno pretense entirely and just go with the full-on anthems because party people are stupid lemmings who like shiny singalong melodies.
Actually, that's a bit unfair. The truth is Techno needs one more intermediary step to go from Detroit to UK to the goofy anthemic singalong peek hour Rave music (ie: the furthest thing from Detroit). Euro Techno is that intermediary step.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that the late 80s and early 90s was the most explosive and creative period in electronic music history. In just three short years some dodgy underground Acid House parties in Chicago erupted around the globe as raves, and what would have been a simple and orderly map of four or five genres had suddenly become over twenty, most of them without names so everyone took to calling everything "techno" or "rave" (a habit that still exists today). The scenes of Drum n Bass, Breakbeat, Progressive, Hardcore and Trance were all created during this period. All of them are still around today, each harboring dozens of genres and subgenres.
This is something of a recurring pattern when it comes to new industries. There is always an initial "wild west" period where several different vendors, formats, and standards compete for marketshare. Over time the strong devour the weak and everything settles down into one or two universal standards that everyone adopts.
This happened with the computer industry in the 80s where Wang, Commodore/Amiga, Atari, Heath, Apple, IBM, Zerox, Acorn, and dozens of other computer manufacturers competed aggressively until things settled down into two standards by the 90s: IBM-PC vs Mac, as deceptively depicted in a series of Apple commercials of the business PC guy who uses his computer for actual work vs the dorky Mac guy who uses his computer for dicking around.
The real question is who has the better career: Justin Long or John Hodgman?
It also happened with the social media revolution in the 00s, where hundreds of profile sites and over-sharing services for a new generation too lazy or stupid to learn HTML and too naive to think that broadcasting every minute of their waking life won't come back to haunt them eventually settled into half a dozen single service digital fingerprints: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, etc.
This also happened with electronic music in the late 80s. Music equipment had become ubiquetous, cheap, and easy enough to use by just about anyone right out of the box. Low barrier to entry plus high weekend enthusiasm means more contributors, and more contributors means more ideas and more concepts. More formats. More standards. More music.
Euro Techno was one of these lesser known formats that was not going to survive the decade. It was a buttered corn-on-the-cob at an all ant Techno picnic. Everything going on around it was louder, brighter, and more expressive, and when the Belgian producers got it in their heads that the new rave partykids were all about "gettin' off yer fookin 'ead mate!", they morphed the sound into something that the ravers could indulge to excess, much like the drugs they kept popping every weekend.
Ish.


## Experimental Techno
*aka:  IDM Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in who knows

Experimental Techno is any kind of Techno that is not regional and doesn't fit into other Techno. You could say it's experimental in that it's trying new things but wouldn't that be a lie? Aren't all new genres technically experimental, in a way?
You could call this the Warp Records catalogue before it invented IDM by way of Ambient Techno, but that was mostly Bleep Techno at the time. Speaking of IDM, you might think that it is the only scene that could lay claim to anything and everything experimental in electronic music. Well you're wrong.
Truth be known, there is a lot of weird Techno out there, with a lot of bizarre moods and styles and utter nuttery. Subgenres upon subgenres and microgenres that behave like subatomic particles, popping in and out of existence so fast they barely exist at all.

The Hamsterdance song is not Experimental Techno but infinitely more interesting.
	

There is a sort of "electronic music elitism" that comes with being a connoisseur of this type of music. Technoheads and IDMtards like to claim that their musical tastes are superior to the junk food genres that the punters devour whole in the clubs. That they are too cool and underground because their music is not mainstream. That their listening choices are more sophisticated because they listen to "dog barking to a beat" or "car door slamming with treated out of tune cello". There is more of this "my music is 2 deep 4 you" nonsense in the IDM scene, so let me just say this:
Dance music is dance music and should never be anything but. Even if it's not danceable, it should at least be listenable at a pertinent emotional level. And while interesting things have been done to classical at the "fucking unlistenable" level (Krzystof Penderecky - Threnody For the Victims Of Hiroshima comes to mind, however it was done as a deliberate exercise to capture the intellectual horror of the subject matter, not as something that anyone actually wants to listen to), no one really makes or listens to it all the time. No, not even Noise. No, you don't. No, fuck you. You don't.
Being different for the sake of being different is maybe interesting as a psychological exercise, but that's not what music is for. We don't listen to music to gain insight into your inner schizophrenia, you tortured hipster. We listen to music to enjoy ourselves. When you listen to music for recognition, that says more about you than it does about the music and none of it is any good. But of course that's what you want, isn't it? It's all about your tragic, misunderstood genius, how you see the world differently than everyone else and that just makes you oh so god damn special.

Vengaboys is also not Experimental Techno but it's still something you'd rather listen to.
	

What am I talking about again? Oh yeah. This is Experimental Techno. Don't you dare sample Threnody To The Victims Of Hiroshima or god help me I will reach through your screen and smack you.
Ish.



## Schranz
*aka:  Progressive Techno, Hard Tekno* in the Techno scene, emerged in late 90s




























Ish.



## Hard Techno
*aka:  Tekno, Free Tekno, Teknival* in the Techno scene, emerged in early 90s

Hard Techno is the official music genre of rave culture. So let me talk about raves now. Real raves.
The raves in the UK in the early 90s were free, renegade, seasonal, and run by ontological anarchists armed with the philosophical weapons of Hakim Bey and Robert Anton Wilson. In the winter months they broke into empty warehouses and occupied them for the night (rave culture loves recessions -- it means more unused urban spaces). In the summer they organized roaming flash mobs to crash police barricades and set up in farmer's fields. They rarely asked permission. What they were doing was illegal so they had to keep moving, and what developed from this radical hedonism was the concept of the mobile soundsystem.
Often situated on the back of flatbed trucks (what the Brits would call lorries) and caravans, the mobile soundsystem became the key to the rave experience. If the rave got busted or shut down by the cops or an angry farmer with a gun, the soundsystem packed up, moved over to the next field, and unloaded the party again. Repeat all night (or week) as necessary or until the drugs wear off. There were no cell phones or Internet back then so people were kept in the know via pirate radio stations and secret info-lines (ie: recorded messages on telephone answering machines).
These soundsystems had names like the rave promoters of yore -- Spiral Tribe, Bedlam, DiY, Circus Warp, Adrenaline, Rough Crew -- and it was these soundsystems that became famous in their own right. The people would locate where their favorite soundsystem was playing on a given weekend and then track it down like rock groupies. It's probably a weird concept to fanboys of certain DJs or producers (or even labels or promoters, you corporate whore), but the point of early raves was never personal fame or glory for anyone. No single person mattered. It was the system that mattered. And it was the system they fought against.
Inside cover of Prodigy - Music For The Jilted Generation
Like a plague of locusts the rave scene rampaged through the UK countryside in the early 90s, building up momentum with each iteration. In addition to middle class citykids eager to try ecstasy, it also attracted the rejects of civilization: Travelers, pikeys, gypsies/romani, crusty hippies, nomads, pagans, squatters and freeloaders.
The organizers and owners of the soundsystems aimed to reclaim public space and occupy them as Pirate Utopias. Being more political-minded and radicalized, they looked nothing like their friendly Acid House forebears: Skinheads wearing jackboots, camo pants and combat fatigues. They had to look scary -- they were the promoters, owners, drug dealers, DJs, and security of their own parties. Just because these are free parties doesn't mean you are free to do anything.
And the music? The music was mostly produced live on the fly, like jam bands at Grateful Dead festivals. It was cheap, simple, disposable, looping thumping Techno music that went on for hours with no break; blistering fast with an abrasive industrial edge, squealing 303s, a sample or two, and terrible sound mixing/mastering. This lo-fi grungy filthy Techno was the punk rock of electronic music. It was never called Hard Techno until years later, before Hardcore got its act together.
The free rave scene finally reached critical mass at the infamous Castlemorton festival from May 22-29, 1992. A rave that lasted seven days with an estimated 100,000 people in attendance. All aforementioned soundsystems were there. It was the rave to end all raves, a worse-organized, more anarchic catastrophic Woodstock. And like Woodstock many old Brit DJs and producers today will tell you that they were there when they probably weren't (and if they were, they're not supposed to remember anything anyway). Even still, everyone who went insists that it was wicked.
Castlemorton (allegedly)
The Authorities had had enough. Thirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested and after a long show trial the UK government passed the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, outlawing all raves (or what it called "any party that plays music with repetitive beats") and beefing up law enforcement to take the problem seriously.
Essentially the bill singled out and outlawed certain lifestyles -- specifically the "techno traveler" kind. The leftover members of Spiral Tribe and other soundsystems fled the country in voluntary exile, and they are still around today as the Free Tekno scene, a traveling circus that backpacks around Europe throwing free parties or Teknivals.
What a Teknival might look like. That smoke in the distance might possibly be tear gas. Teknivals get raided a lot. You're not a real participant in this scene until your party gets busted by the Police and you have to outrun the dogs.
Back in the UK the rave scene decided if it wanted to survive it had to go legit and comply with the laws. 1994 is a pivotal year: Everything after this year is safe, boring, and club-friendly, making shitty Eurotrance music for grandmothers and 8-year-olds, the edges completely smoothed out of what was not just a vibrant and revolutionary form of music but a lifestyle and culture.
Finding music of the very early free party scene is actually quite tricky because not a lot of it was recorded or pressed to wax (or, that is, not a lot compared to how much was made live in dozens of raves every weekend for years). And what music I do have was released well after the rave scene was crushed. And it's kind of hard to catalogue music that has no name, no label, no artist, no identification. It is Temporary Autonomous Zone music -- it exists only where it is needed, which is at a free rave. Not a music guide.
Ish.


## Bleep Techno
*aka:  UK Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in late 80s

Bleep Techno is a valiant attempt by the United Kingdom to make Detroit Techno.
Raves had taken over the English countryside with such ferocity that by 1990 they were declared a public nuisance. Mobile parties could be thrown anywhere within hours with thousands of partiers showing up unannounced in a farmer's field like a colorful flash mob bringing their Detroit Techno and Chicago House records (as well as tons of drugs) to dance the night away.
These parties were renegade, clandestine, often lasted days, and there was nothing the Police could do to stop them (not unless they had a lot of handcuffs. This is the UK -- cops don't have guns there. They have whistles and bowler hats).
It wasn't long before the UK scene tried its own hand at making electronic music rather than import expensive records from Detroit, Chicago and New York every week. This homegrown variant of Detroit Techno was properly called UK Techno but is better known for the slang term Bleep. Probably as a reference to their weak-ass attempts to replicate the busy sound effects on Model 500 - No UFO's.
It seems like that was the one thing -- possibly the only thing -- that they got from Detroit Techno: That it contained a lot of futuristic sound effects. Beeps and boops and zips and blips and Star Trek zaps and R2D2 tweets and radar technician from Spaceballs bleeps, sweeps and creeps.

I want to say that they were attempting to emulate the 808 cowbell sound because a peculiar thing about UK Techno (and European music in general at the time) is that it rarely used the TR-808 drum machine. The Linndrum was for Italo and the TR-909 was for house, but the 808 just didn't catch on in Europe like it did stateside. I have no idea why. The answer better not be racist.
Some Bleep Techno producers used the Yamaha RX-5 drum machine which wasn't a big seller but a lot of bands in England used it for some reason.
If 1988 was the "Acid House" era of rave evolution then 1989 was the "Techno" era where these lovey-dovey partykids hiked up on MDMA (an abbreviation for "hey man I love you because you're you") came to the realization that the serotonin was gone and they were burning dopamine.
Consequently, the music got harder and more abrasive and was no more than a year or two away from launching five entire scenes all by itself and all from the UK: Rave/Hardcore, Drum n Bass, Breakbeat, Progressive and IDM. It was like The Beatles going from Help! to Dr. Pepper in a year and a half. It was a very special time to be a fan of electronic music but an even more special time to be a UK music writer of electronic music.
I'm sure there is at least one UK music writer who loves to gush over this period because UK music writers love writing about UK music, and glorifying UK music's contribution to humanity with haughty superlatives. You've met this type of UK music writer before. Let's call him Simon Reynolds -- the Bill Walton of electronic music. Sometimes you appreciate his eclectic perspective and purple polishing of facts and events but other times you just wish he'd shut the fuck up.
Some of the early rave scene's most popular and pretentious musicians came out of the Bleep Techno period including Amorphous Androgynous, Indo Tribe, Mental Cube, Smart Systems, and The Future Sound of London.
Here we see Yage hard at work at making subtle adjustments to something you'll never notice.
Bleep Techno was a short-lived thing, existing only until its producers got a proper bearing on what Techno was supposed to sound like. But rather than fix their deficiencies and go Detroit, they got harder and went Rave, which is very much solving a problem by making it a bigger problem but not disliking the result a whole lot.
Ish.


## Detroit Techno
*aka:  Classic Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in mid 80s

It must have been a curious thing to see at the time.
Affluent middle class black youth living in the peaceful Detroit suburb of Belleville Michigan in the late 70s, raised by the scions of the automative industry. They had money to spend and parties to attend but rather than identify with the harsh street sounds of Rap coming out of New York, they looked instead toward mainland Europe to emulate the latest trends in fashion and music.
Like its cousin Electro, Detroit Techno also has distinctly "oreo" roots. These parties of black teenagers wearing Gucci and Armani and dancing to Italo Disco and Hi NRG carried a completely different vibe than the block parties of Rap's poverty-stricken demographics.
It took Rap almost an entire decade -- and some fortuitous circumstances -- to scrounge together enough money just to cut a record. The kids in Detroit had it easy compared to Harlem. When they needed their music fix, they tuned into the Electrifying Mojo radio show where he would play the hottest imports from Italy, France and Germany.

This is actually recorded in March 1989 at the Brotherhood Club in Detroit. No videos of those super early Belleville parties exist that I know of, but you get the gist.
	

It didn't take long for these kids to attempt their own European space disco music. Money was not an obstacle so they bought gear, fiddled with the knobs and the result was A Number of Names - Sharevari. It wasn't Techno. It wasn't really anything. It was basically a cross between Kraftwerk - Home Computer and Telex - Moskow Diskow. But it still contained that cold mechanicalism that would characterize almost all Detroit music in the 80s (as opposed to the warmth of Chicago House or the soul of Garage). Who knows why Detroit music always sounds this way but it's a distinctly Detroit thing. You can even hear it in Rhythim is Rhythim - Strings of Life, which is a Detroit attempt at upbeat piano-laced Chicago House but still coming off stiff and mechanized. Even with upbeat piano fills.
Yes there was also Cybotron but it was mostly a Kraftwerk ripoff until Planet Rock's release, then it shifted into being more of an Electro ripoff, with more funk and vocals and less robot pop.
The word "Techno" was probably lifted from futurist Alvin Toffler's "The Third Wave", unless it wasn't and it was either a play on Disco or shamelessly stolen from some other blitzed-out futurist like Douglas Coupland or Terrence McKenna.
If you would like a definitive "initial first prime original absolute #1 start of the source of the birth of Techno ever track", I would say its Cybotron - Techno City in 1984. Juan Atkins would go on to establish the Techno blueprint a year later with Model 500, but this track really captured the harrowing future to come for Detroit which is a running theme throughout Techno. It's the first track to sound like actual Techno. It's even got the genre in the name. How can you argue with that?
If you're wondering what separates Techno from House/Garage/Trance/Disco/Synthpop and all the rest of the 4-to-the-floor repetitive Daft Punk sounding genres, listen to its warmth. It has none. Comparisons to blenders and washing machines are apt because Techno is at its core machine music, reflecting the grisly assembly plants and factory presses of Detroit's automotive industry.
The founders of Techno crafted a form of music without soul, as cold and monolithic and impersonal as the machines that made it, unfeeling and unwavering. Ironically they were trying to find the soul in the machine, or to imbue their own souls into it. It's a difficult concept to grasp when music is supposed to evoke an emotion. Why would anyone want to make something that has none of that? Here is a form of music that detatches itself from the human condition to turn itself, and you, into a machine.
Like a hard liquor Techno is an acquired taste, appreciated for its precision, its perfection, its simplicity. And its inhumanity. If you ever go through an emotional breakup, I recommend listening to Techno. It helps you feel nothing.
And who are the 'founders' that I speak of? Oh, these guys right here:
What music pioneers might look like.
It wouldn't be completely fair to call Detroit Techno bleak. It's still full of hope and optimism for a technological future, but it always feels paralyzed by the dehumanization of technology.
The future, according to Detroit, was going to be less like Star Trek and more like The Terminator. Or for a more on-the-nose example: Robocop, the 1987 action movie about an actual futuristic Detroit saved by an actual futuristic robot cop who spends most of the movie being a psychotic vigilante out for sadistic revenge rather than a genuinely impartial agent of law enforcement. He's the hero Detroit deserves.
But Detroit has a reason to feel this way. It is a single-industry town in which the industry was slowly eroded in the last quarter of the twentieth century not by depletion or overseas competition (though that didn't help), but through automation.
From 1979 to 1984 nearly 50% of all African-American industrial autoworkers lost their jobs. That work has never been sufficiently recouped. Machines liberated us from work but they also liberated us from earning a living. Detroit Techno saw this happening in real time and expressed apprehension at this brave new world of human obsolescence. And they ironically expressed it through job-killing drum machines and music gear.
Despite such heady and mythological origins, in truth Detroit Techno was never more than a regional genre and it never blew up like House, Garage or Rap. That is, until 1988 when this generic mean-nothing uneventful compilation made it overseas:
If they called it Poopyfart, today we would all be waxing nostalgic about the oldskool Detroit Poopyfart sound of the Belleville Trio.
It's not a very good compilation. It's not even a very accurate portrayal of the Techno coming out of Detroit at the time (maybe House, but not Techno). But it hit the UK rave scene at just the right time, when the Acid House wave was winding down and people were eager for a new type of sound. They spent the previous year gargling Chicago House records and this compilation invited them to give Detroit a swish. And the name: Techno. It's the type of catchy word marketers dream of coming up with and trademarking, those soulless parasites.
After this point, people called it Techno. It was all Techno. The music was called Techno music. The parties were called Techno parties. The fans were called "people who went to Techno parties to listen to Techno music".
From then on everything that was beat-driven and made entirely by machines, from House to Eurodance to Downtempo to post-Disco, was Techno. In the news, in the media, on school playgrounds. Techno was that "Oonce Oonce Oonce Oonce" music and to a large extent electronic music is still called that umbrella term today (when they're not calling it the gag-enducing EDM or, god forbid, electronica).
The Detroit Techno dudes who grew up idolizing European synthesizer music were now idolized in Europe. This spawned a number of Techno subgenres across the ocean, all of them interesting for various reasons that have nothing to do with Detroit. And for those who want Detroit Techno to stay Detroit (perhaps even a little too Detroit), there's always the 313 list -- a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
But it was the word 'Techno' that blew up and not the actual sound, and for this reason Detroit felt somewhat ashamed to associate their city with marked-up prancing goofball euroshite and I don't blame them. It even became a rite of passage for electronic music snobs to correct everybody they met about the true sound of Techno. Especially as raves caught on stateside and genre Nazis became chafed at all the mislabelling. You can probably stop doing that now.
For almost an entire decade Detroit dis-acknowledged itself with the word, only coming to terms with it and accepting its place in electronic music folklore shortly after the 2000s (ie: after the "electronica" era dissipated in the mainstream).
Nothing captures the pride and agony of Detroit better than this picture.
With time comes restitution. Detroit took the word back with a big-ass music festival, an exhibit in the Detroit Historical Museum (right beside the Motown exhibit), and even car companies celebrated their special heritage with the city:

Proof that advertising works: I was tempted to buy a Ford Focus back in the day based solely on this ad.(Model 500 - No UFO's)
	

Things have come full circle. Techno is once again the embodiment of Detroit.
Detroit Techno is still around because something this important will never die, even if what is today considered Detroit Techno sounds nothing like original Detroit Techno. The only real criteria for genuine Detroit Techno seems to be: Is the guy from Detroit? If yes, then it's Detroit Techno (unless it happens to be Minimal Techno or Dub Techno).
Ish.


## Bangin Techno
*aka:  Detroit Techno, German Techno, Swedish Techno, Latin Techno, Italo Techno, Jtech* in the Techno scene, emerged in mid 90s

Bangin Techno is Detroit Techno (and to a lesser extent Swedish Techno and German Techno but more on that later).
It is more of a descriptive catch-all than a genre, but it is the most accessible and the most interesting, and for that reason it is as close to sleek and shiny commercial product for grandmothers and 8-year-olds as Techno is willing to get. You can even sing along to it -- why else do you think Aztec Mystic - Jaguar blew up? It had a catchy hook just like any pop song. That's also why Sony-BMG ripped it off without permission or compensation. Gee, for being such a staunch anti-corporate music genre, Detroit Techno sure gets burned a lot.
Bangin Techno started out as a paragon of repetitive, percolating progression of perfunctory percussion that perfectly parallels shoes, keys, belts, coins, bunched up socks, and a baseball all stuck in a laundry dryer. It is Detroit Techno at its most machinelike essence, catalyzed raw efficiency to such an extent that after awhile people were wondering why the two were separated in the first place.
So at some point in the 00s they folded back together and everyone called it all Detroit Techno again. Even the stuff made by people not from Detroit.
I should also mention that Frankie Bones played a huge part in Bangin Techno too, and I mention this only because if I don't he'll complain about it. In fact, the first thing he probably did when visiting this guide was search for his name.
Bangin Techno also serves as a collection of regional Detroit-sounding genres and there are a lot of them that emerged in the mid to late 90s, all with subtle local flavoring. The biggest are Swedish Techno and German Techno mostly due to the efforts of Adam Beyer and Chris Liebing, respectively.
But there are also healthy scenes in Italy (Italo Tech), Japan (Jtech) and Spain/Mexico/Brazil (Latin Techno). It would not suit this guide's purposes to have a hundred country-specific Techno genres. Why would you want to look at something like that? That's just picking the fly shit out of the pepper.
Detroit Techno has always been more of a DJ's genre. The records are released as repetitive loops, like half-finished songs with no melody or vocals (sometimes), often as battle tools or beats & breaks samplers with plenty of space between them on the vinyl to aid the DJ in his quick cuts and mixes.
The art of DJing is to combine these songlets together to create original compositions (you'd be surprised how many of the more famous DJs don't know how to do this). Good DJs can stitch the compositions expertly until it sounds like one seamless 90 minute song made up of 40 or 50 parts of songs (the gold standard for perfect DJ mixes being Richie Hawtin's Decks, EFX & 909). The end result is not as anal-retentively technical as Turntablism but still enjoyable and as an added bonus it pisses off the trainspotters. Especially if it's all white labels.
Just one man, alone with his tool.
Bangin Techno represents the last great interesting wave of Techno. After Detroit reeled in its spinoff genres things got super plinky plonky and DJs we once thought were untouchable (looking at you Mr. Hawtin) got really boring.
Ish.


## Dub Techno
*aka:  Deep Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in mid 90s

Dub Techno is Minimal Techno with Dub. Literally that's what it is. And it doesn't have to come from Detroit. In fact, it was probably invented by people not from Detroit. But don't tell them that.
In much the same way two countries might find a beneficial economic relationship where one mines coal and sends it to the other country and the other burns it to smelt iron and carbon into steel and sends the steel back to the first country and the first country fabricates the steel into useful parts for the second country to assemble into bikes and cars that are sold back in the first country (that actually happened in some industries with USA and Japan -- it's somehow cheaper to make finished goods that way instead of doing everything in one country). This really long analogy also describes the symbiotic relationship America and Germany have with Techno, each passing it back and forth and adding their own vibe to it. Dub Techno is a German invention of an American genre of a Jamaican concept.
You can't really talk about Dub Techno without mentioning Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, better known as the eponymous Round One, the indispendable Round Two, the essential Round Three, the authoritative Round Four, and who can forget the legendarily epic Round Five.
They're trying to go the distance against Rocky.
Basic Channel is very important in the world of Dub Techno. To put it in a better context, Basic Channel was the Burial of the 90s, not in terms of forward-thinking musicianship or experimentation (what would be the point of that?), but in their esoteric knack for acquiring a pretentious and insufferable fanbase.
A German Duo by birthreich, Basic Channel probably invented Dub Techno when they heard Aphex Twin - Xtal one day and figured a whole genre could be made out of that "underwater" sound, which wasn't a bad idea.
Unfortunately, their efforts gave Techno the legendary "techno snob" stereotype (years before hipsters became a thing), who use their appreciation of Dub Techno as a shortcut to sophistication the way fat people use gluten as a shortcut to losing weight. As if enjoying the addition of a simple delay pedal or effects processor automatically makes one intellectual. Dub Techno fans are second only to Radiohead fans in their love of smelling their own farts.
Basic Channel is important, but they really are the ranch flavor of the genre. Saying you like Dub Techno because you're into Basic Channel is like saying you like EDM because you heard a Moby song one time.
Being somewhat spacey, dubby, and heavy with bassy effects and reverb, Dub Techno can be considered a cousin of Ambient Techno which is neither Ambient nor Techno (military intelligence, friendly fire, moral majority, jumbo shrimp, walking dead, etc.) but actually IDM.
Not even Ambient Techno fans want to deal with Dub Techno fans, and Ambient Techno also has a pretentious stick up its bum. These two sides go together like sweet & sour ranch dressing with Skittles and peanut butter. Out come the glocks if you see them at a party. They don't fuck around.
Dub Techno is still around these days, although ironically most of the artists pushing it aren't from Detroit or Germany, and a lot of it gets either misconstrued as, or mashed together with, Deeptech, Minimal Tech or Psydub -- its identity tragically co-opted by other genres.
Which is probably for the best because the last thing we need is some annoying revivalist Pitchfork writer dickriding Basic Channel again.
Ish.


## Minimal Techno
*aka:  Detroit Techno* in the Techno scene, emerged in early 90s

Minimal Techno is Detroit Techno.
It was spearheaded by Detroit's infamous "second wave of Techno" producers in the early 90s who had become mortified with what the Europeans did to Techno. And by Detroit I mean southern Ontario. I'll explain later.
Techno had become a bastardized term by the 90s. Somehow white Europeans had co-opted black American music that had been co-opted from white European music and co-opted it for really white Europeans. With, like, anthems and fanfares and whistles and horns n shit.
The natural reaction from the Detroit purists was to distance themselves from this so-called "Techno" sound raging across Europe infecting televisions everywhere with shitcatcher pants and go-go dancers (which wasn't actually Techno but that's what everyone called it).

What people thought Techno was in 1991. It should be noted that this family turned off hardcore Gangsta Rap for this.
	

Summed up, Minimal Techno is a stubborn rejection of Techno. It marked the beginning of a romanticization of a mythology that's so pure and brilliant that it never has to interfere with real life.
The more Europe stuffed its music full of busy sound effects, samples, rapping, hooks and anthems and other extraneous nonsense, the more Detroit Techno regressed into something simple, basic, and form befitting function, like Japanese art.
Mt. Fuji, or what it would look like if the Japanese designed their own mountain.
No scene is more protective of its own past than Techno. History is written by the winners or those who like to think they've won by marketing their struggle as an Underground Resistance against the evil, oppressive forces of commercial exploitation, like an ironic electronic music equivalent of Rage Against The Machine.
Minimal Techno has crowned itself the gatekeeper of all that is real, true, or acceptable Techno. That's a protip: If you want to make genuine Techno, you gotta go through them.
Of course this didn't stop the punters. The rise of the Tech House genres of Minimal Tech and Deeptech in the 2000s confused the hell out of a lot of dumb online record stores who took to labelling them all Minimal Techno when they have nothing to do with Detroit Minimal Techno which is a Detroit Techno genre that comes from Detroit because it's from Detroit, and did I mention it's from Detroit? Well, it's from Detroit. Not Berlin -- Detroit.
Ironically, the originators of the Minimal Detroit Techno sound were not actually from Detroit but instead were three white dorks from Canada (Richie, John and Dan), who had to prove to the insular black Techno fraternity that they and their label Plus 8 not only belonged but were in fact more Detroit than those OG Techno dudes.
Canadian Techno? What is this, some kind of expansion team or something?
Minimal Techno is a battle tool genre. The songs are short, rarely labeled, and are primarily meant for mixing rather than listened to by themselves. DJs like to faderslam tracks every 32 bars (or however fast it takes to impress you) or mashup different tracks to create new compositions.
There is never much going on in a Minimal Techno track so the artist has to entertain you in other ways. Like, for instance, a baffling music video:

90s electronic music videos are proof that people will listen to a dull song if the video is entertaining.(Plastikman - Converge)
	

Minimal Techno doesn't really exist anymore, mostly out of confusion over what it is. Go to any music sharing site you want -- Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Last.fm, Spotify, Bandcamp, DI, hell even Youtube -- and search for Minimal Techno mixes. You can't find any; it's all Deeptech/Minimal Tech. No one actually plays Minimal Techno outside of the 313. Not even at Tresor or Berghain.
Minimal Techno doesn't have anything to do with the old 70s genre of Minimalism. It's not just "Minimalism with a beat" but it does appeal to its aesthetics: Long repetitive loops that slowly evolve over time, sparse soundscapes, and simple basic lead lines. And it doesn't use bass very much -- for that you need to move on to Dub Techno. That's where most Minimal Techno producers migrated to anyway.
Ish.

# Electro

## Electro
*aka:  Technopop, Robotpop, Electro Rap, Electrobreaks* in the Electro scene, emerged in early 80s

There are whole libraries full of books about how white music culture is just a safe and boring pastiche of black music culture. From Jazz to Blues to Rock n Roll to Funk and to a lesser extent even Hip Hop, white America's greatest musical innovations have all been sheepishly stolen from the black man, often without any credit or compensation.
Rarely is it mentioned that cultural appropriation works both ways, that on a select few occasions the black man has also stolen -- and expanded upon -- the innovations of square-ass stuffy-headed white dorks. Electro is one of those genres. And those square-ass stuffy-headed white dorks were Kraftwerk.
The lads in Dusseldorf waiting for the Trans Europe It's Fucking Late Again.
Kraftwerk were trying to capture the machine sounds of every day urban industrial living: Automotive factories, drill presses, washers and dryers, and the unrelenting grinding yawn of a futuristic society increasingly dominated by technology. The fact that they always came off as unemotional robots in their live shows was part of that.
Kraftwerk had catchy melodies, terrible lyrics and vocals (except when they use vocoders), but their main strength was percussion. They were impeccable percussionists. They built their own electronic drumkits a decade before the first drum machines hit the market and their attention to detail was evident in the percolating rhythms and grooves of their drum tracks.

It's More Fun To Compute. Kraftwerk music goes great with 50s sci-fi b-movies.
	

There are whole libraries full of books about Kraftwerk and their indelible contribution not just to electronic music but to all music. They can be mentioned in the same breath as The Beatles and James Brown as one of the most influential musical acts of the latter half of the 20th century. They were even a gag on The Simpsons:

Track is Keoki - Caterpillar (Rabbit In The Moon's Disco 2001 Mix) which kind of deflates the Kraftwerk joke.
	

This is really something I do not need to expound upon. Go ahead, punch 'Kraftwerk' into the I'm Feeling Lucky button on Google and learn for yourself.
So let me paint a different portrait of electronic music in the late 70s, a huge scene of which Kraftwerk were not The Definition but merely just another experimental electronic band, no different than Tangerine Dream or Vangelis or Giorgio Moroder or Jean-Michel Jarre or Brian Eno or Wendy Carlos or Robert fucking Moog.
Or Yellow Magic Orchestra.
Not a racist term -- that is what they called themselves. It was a different time, you see.
YMO -- the quirky Japanese trio every bit as experimental and catchy as Kraftwerk. They have a lot in common: They both came from cultures that had to be rebooted after 1945, they both looked forward to the future rather than the past to make their music, and they both used electronic instruments as a way to experiment with new sounds and textures. And it's not like The Electrifying Mojo didn't cane both of them to death on his radio show in Detroit and it's not like latter generations of musicians (including Human League and Orbital) didn't also remix, sample and cover the living shit out of YMO.
So why is one deified when the other is not? Why does Huffington Post and Cracked write nostalgic articles on 2-time Grammy Award winning Kraftwerk while YMO never gets any love?
At this point it just feels like Kraftwerk has better PR. They get more iconic the further back they pass into history and music writers continuously release books about how important they were and how Afrika Bambaataa lifted (he didn't sample -- he recreated) the melody from Trans Europe Express and the break from Numbers to create an entire cultural movement:


Good artists sample, great artists steal.
	

And it's Planet Rock that everyone samples (because Bambaataa put the drum break as a battle tool on the b-side) in Electro, Technobass and Freestyle. Not technically Kraftwerk.
If Bambaataa is the focal point for the immortalization of Kraftwerk and the existence of Electro, would we be having this discussion if he sampled YMO instead? Would Electro exist at all, or did it need to heist Kraftwerk in order to happen? And what kind of alternative Philip K Dick dystopian future would that lead to, and how could it possibly be worse than this one? I'm sure some self-important music writer has already written lengthy fan fiction on this.
After the Earth-shattering revelation of Planet Rock, Electro sheared off into different paths -- Electrofunk, Rap, Freestyle, Techno, and Technobass all emerged as self-contained genres spawned from Electro within just a few short years. While most of these genres went on to bigger and better things, Electro itself bottomed out in the late 80s and by the 90s it was seen as an archaic relic of an era dominated by shitty sounding drum machines and analog monosynths, with maybe only the Jedi Knights keeping the faith alive. Most of its producers moved on to Technobass anyway.
Oh, of course it came back. You know it came back. Everyone knows it came back -- or they think they do.
For some reason names in electronic music tend to get reused and repurposed by each generation. A culture blissfully ignorant of its own history will tend to use the same label for multiple things. That's not the fault of Millenials, marketers or even music writers. It's just a dumb thing that happens.
Such as it was, the "electro" that came back in the 00s was not actual Electro and had scarce little to do with it. Despite the namesake, the dominance of "electro" in the club scene that gave us Electroclash, Electrohouse, and Filthy Electrohouse are not Electro genres.

A tour through Electro and its derivatives. No Electrohouse was used in the making of this mix.
	

If you came here looking for Electrohouse, try the Eurotrash scene. This scene is about Electro only -- the original robot sound. Go away, poseur.
Ish.


## Florida Breaks
*aka:  Orlando Breaks* in the Electro scene, emerged in mid 90s

Florida Breaks is the pop-infused, sample-heavy, more white but in no way less cool southern cousin of Electro. It is technically a Breakbeat genre but it came from Freestyle and Electro.
Florida Breaks is the quintessential 90s genre. It has breakdowns, builds, and anthems. It has breakbeat samples and 808 bass and acid (sometimes). It has vocoders and vocal samples and hypeman shouts. It has anthems and orchestral stabs. It has car sirens and air sirens and the Star Trek TNG red alert siren. It has scratching and 4-bar cuts and megamixes. It has guys wearing baseball hats and grabbing them when they dance.
When Sonic the Hedgehog gets down, he's almost always breakin' to Florida Breaks. Either that or New Jack Swing (depending on the era). This is music for b-boying, buoying, boyoying and boytoying.
Florida breaks like a dollar store condom.
The man most responsible for this nonsense was probably DJ Icey who caned his "everything but the kitchen sink" bass music records through his own label at his Orlando nightclub. This spread around the country awfully fast. If you were going to a Breaks party in the late 90s, it either sounded like this or Big Beat.
Florida music in the early 90s looked like a bucket of Neapolitan ice cream. The southern Miami area of America's dong had the chocolate Bass, the northen Jacksonville area had Atlanta-flavored vanilla Hip Hop, and the middle -- Orlando -- had this. The Breakbeat. The strawberry. I am not making a racial joke.
Like most things in Florida, things got weird and out of hand really quickly and the first rave overdoses and deaths were recorded here, prompting a special episode of ABC's 20/20 to sensationalize these crazy all-night drug-fueled rave parties as the newest moral panic for pearl-clutching parents.

Noone likes to be left alone. Especially when they don't know right from wrong. Parents, where's your child?
	

Thank you, ABC, for compelling millions of unassuming youth to check out these rave things -- the exact opposite of what you intended, a demonstration of the Streisand Effect before it was called the Streisand Effect.
As with most genres, Florida Breaks had overstayed its welcome and by the end of the 90s the state's unique Neapolitan flavor was crushed under the imposing weight of the Ultra Music Festival, which mashed all regional musical dialects into a single, unifying boring paste.

Now instead of eclectic local flavor we get stale international DJs caning marked up euroshite. We were probably better off with the raves and overdoses. Just saying.
Ish.


## Freestyle
*aka:  R&B, Latin Electro* in the Electro scene, emerged in early 80s

Freestyle is what happens when you take the Planet Rock break and add female vocals to it.
It doesn't have anything to do with freestyling, the Freestylers, or freeing your style, or styling your frees. It's just Freestyle. It's Electro + R&B. That's it. Why is it called Freestyle? I have no idea. And no one else does either. I do not come up with these names. Well, sometimes.
Nor does it have anything to do with the Ford Freestyle, a crossover utility vehicle sold in the 2000s for when you inadvertently volunteer to be your child's soccer team's equipment manager.
It's interesting how changing one little feature can completely alter the complexion of a genre. Remove the rapping and vocoders and replace them with R&B diva vocals and it suddenly doesn't sound like Electro anymore, but rather something girly and club-friendly. Less robot pop and more real pop.
Freestyle was born in New York (where else) as an Electro subgenre but it had more success in Miami and South Florida as the decade wore on. You could argue that it started with Shannon - Let the Music Play or even C-Bank - One More Shot but I don't like to count it because it has R&B legend Jenny Burton on vocals and Freestyle vocalists are almost all characteristically bad. That is, they're not as good as Soul/R&B divas nor do they try to sing like them, and that's part of the charm of Freestyle: Its limitations. You can karoake these songs without much effort.
But there's an even quirkier track that captures the genre without having any relation to it. Somehow.
Across the ocean in Manchester, Factory Records (technically their Belgium subsidiary but let's not get too pedantic here) -- that innovative originator of everything crazy that happened to British music in the 80s from Punk to Synthpop to Acid House to Rave -- released a track in February 1983 by Disco/R&B group 52nd Street (yes, probably named after the Billy Joel song) called Cool as Ice.

The program director for this show is working well above his pay grade.
	

It was Electro. It was Acid. It was female vocals singing American-style. And it existed in England in 1983, predating Freestyle and Acid House by several years, as if foretelling the future. How does something like that happen? Was it an influence or a fluke? Was it just another one of Factory's crazy one-offs or did they really get a sense that something new and special was about to happen?
There was no followup to this phenomenon. The single barely charted but it was released under A&M Records in NYC later on in the year as well as a Jellybean remix so it's likely someone in Shannon's circle would have heard of it. But it could be an example of convergent evolution in musical taxonomy except the style was not viable in the UK (at least, not immediately) whereas it took off in America. That happens sometimes.
Freestyle was biggest in the late 80s with acts like Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam, The Cover Girls, and Corina all receiving generous radio time. It heavily influenced R&B and New Jack Swing, who promptly removed its cold Electro percussion and introduced horn fills, congas and of course the ever-ubiquetous orchestra hit (which was probably sampled from Yes - Owner of a Lonely Heart or even Stravinsky - The Firebird Ballet since the original came from a patch on the super expensive Fairlight CMI Series IIx. But I digress).
Nothing wrong with that until Miami Sound Machine and Gloria Estefan went to town on it, which is a slice of Freestyle akin to a corporate Powerpoint presentation that evokes the kind of played-out 80s ubiquity normally reserved for Huey Lewis and the News or Lionel Richie.
Freestyle came back in the 90s but then was consumed by Florida Breaks. It technically still exists today but usually as covers, reissues or remixes of its former glory. It is not necessarily a thing anymore.
Ish.

# Hip Hop

## Turntablism
*aka:  Scratching, DJing, Mashup, Chopped And Screwed* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in early 80s

Turntablism is the really rich super sweet frozen chocolate mousse of the electronic music pantheon. It's best not to consume it in large doses unless you want a tummy ache. It's about quality over quantity.
Turntablism owes its entire existence to the Technics SL-1200 direct drive turntable which is super important so allow me to go on an aside about this magnificent piece of equipment also known as the 12s, the Tech 12s, the decks, the tables, the spinners, the platters, the ones and twos, the wheels of steel, the record players, the black crack addiction, the world's most expensive hobby, the revolvy thingies that play the music, the obnoxious pretentious music dork hipster machine, the "you don't even own any records why do you have this stupid record player" expensive paperweight.
This is the iconic mk2 version, released in 1978.
The Technics SL-1200 was preferred over all other record players for its durability. These things were built like Russian tanks. I've seen Tech 12s dropped down flights of stairs, fallen off balconies, off moving cars, get hosed on, puked on, poured on with sticky cola and bourbon, left in the rain, set on fire, and even buried under three feet of sand -- and they still worked flawlessly. You could build a fridge out of Tech 12s and then hide in the fridge to survive a nuclear explosion. They are virtually indestructable.
Most record players hate being touched. The Tech 12 can be touched, pushed, stopped, back-spinned, slowed, and manually manipulated in any way you want. And when you let go, it always bounces right back to its regular speed with no delay. It is next to impossible to wreck the motor and its simple design (3 buttons, a knob and a slider) means a shallow learning curve and low barrier to entry. For some reason Technics stopped making the vinyl playing unit in 2010, but brought it back in 2016 after a public outcry complained about lost heritage or something.
Once DJs figured out how use the Tech 12 as an instrument, and then invented things like scratching, beatmatching, beat juggling, backspinning, hip hopping, cutting, mixing, phrase locking, stylus drifting, fresh making, torque resisting, buttplugging, serato bragging, fader slamming, fart knocking, pretend touching, the Jesus Christ pose, and of course needle care, cleaning and replacement, the only limit was their imagination.
Turntablists like to set up their tables battle style (sideways), so that the platter can be closer to the mixer and the tonearm and pitch control are on the far side where they won't get in the way.
When Turntablists go record shopping they don't look for hit records as much as they look for battle tools -- the b-sides of records that might contain isolated beats, breaks, acapellas, or even white noise at various tempos and pitches. They can use these tracks to scratch with or combine with other battle tools to build frankensongs on the fly.
Such a supremely technical profession, where muscle memory is executed in hundredths of a second and showmanship is everything, would invariably turn very competitive. Fortunately they found an outlet for their one-upmanship, and if we truly lived in Marty McFly's glorious shining future and not Biff Tannon's alternate dystopian one, the DJ Mag Top 100 would at least pretend to acknowledge the fact that not only do Turntablists exist, but they are better than any horrendous Hardstyle jock who has ever dribbled down the asscrack of the Dutch club scene.
The DMC community has its own problems -- namely, no one works with vinyl anymore. Purists complain that bringing in controllers and touchpads to beef up Serato-enabled sets is a form of cheating. The counter argument is that the purists are a bunch of nobs who complain about everything.
Introducing gimmicks to add variety to a rhythm-based artform that thrives on creativity but had exhausted every possible permutation of cadence and rhythm decades ago may be the one thing that saves Turntablism from stagnation. This is a very heated rift in the DMC community. Every scene and genre has its conflicts. It's part of human nature to form tribes and in-group/out-group categories. As with most things, there is an xkcd for that:

The loopists are totally ruining the scene, man.
Turntablism is a fascinating artform but much like progressive rock a lot of it is pretentious performance wankery. Nobody wants to hear Neil Peart 16 hour drum solos on 32 toms (not even hardcore Rush fans), and while shredding 64th notes through five octaves on your Ibanez EGEN8 Herman Li Signature is technically amazing, that's not why people listen to music.
But there is an audience of super sperglords who are super intense about this super seriously, and they seem to have missed the point behind music also.
As if recognizing that this is a problem (or maybe because there was nothing left for Turntablism to do), a number of pseudo-genres have emerged to try and take Turntablism in a different direction, like Chopped And Screwed (which isn't a genre insomuch as it's just a technique like Vaporwave or Nightcore). But the most famous pseudo-genre is Mashup.
Immensely popular (mostly due to the renegade mix DJ Z-Trip & DJ P - Uneasy Listening Vol. 1 which contained far too many copyright infringing samples/songs to be released commercially... and also Radio Soulwax' 2 Many DJ's mix series), Mashup was all about finding the acapella of one song (usually a rap) and the instrumental of another (usually 80s Synthpop) and putting them together to create a frankensong. Sometimes it worked, most times it didn't, but Mashups are popular and so easy that I often make quick and dirty drunken Mashups.
As for Turntablism, it's best appreciated in five minute doses here and there, like candy sprinkles on a Sundae. But not an entire set. That'll just rot your teeth.
Ish.


## Themed Rap
*aka:  Nerdcore, Horrorcore, Basketball Rap, Weed Rap, Comedy Rap* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in early 90s

This is technically not a genre. This is a collection of genres grouped together because Hip Hop is a massive global scene with hundreds of topical genres, subgenres, regional genres, and language/country specific genres. Someday I may get around to talking about them but I don't plan on doing anything about it right now.
Themed Rap is dominated by topical themes. The themes can be anything and there are a lot of them and any Rap group can create a new one by rapping about that one thing, but the most common themes tend to be basketball (Basketball Rap), weed (Weed Rap), and the occult (Horrorcore -- rapping about ghosts, vampires and supernaturalism). 
There are also subgenres involving opera (Hip Hopera), Victorian England/Steampunk (Chap Hop), Christianity (Christian Rap -- and yes, it sucks just as much as Christian Rock or Christian Folk or Christian anything), the Mafia (rappers sure do love referencing The Godfather and Scarface) and even LGBTQ (Homo Hop).
If you look hard enough you can probably even find Beer Rap or Dookie Rap which is probably just a beat and riffing on John Witherspoon samples -- that one's free, aspiring producers. Go out there and make it happen.
There are also a ton of fusion subgenres like Rapcore, Rap Metal, Rap Rock, Rock Rap, Rocking Rap Rock Rap Rap, Country Rap That Doesn't Sound Like Cotton Eye Joe, but those aren't really electronic so there are no samples here. And let's be honest: Do you really want Linkin Park on this guide? Of course not. That's stupid.
But of all the Themed Rap subgenres, the largest one is probably Nerdcore.
MC Router. Nerds take their Hip Hop very seriously.
You are probably already into Nerdcore without even knowing it. Do you like the musical Hamilton? That's Nerdcore. Do you like Lonely Island and Weird Al Yankovic Rap parodies or any parody song on Napster mistakened for Weird Al? That's Nerdcore. Do you like Youtube stars like Bo Burnham and the Gregory Bros? That's Nerdcore. Do you like raps about Predator, Aliens or The Terminator? Of course you do. Let's watch one.




Remember the old Star Wars Gangsta Rap flash movies? Nerdcore. Remember MC Hawking? Nerdcore. Epic Rap Battles of History? Nerdcore (of which Voltaire's boast "Let me be frank, don't mess with the Frank who hangs with B. Franks giving ladies beef franks" in the Western Philosophers vs Eastern Philosophers ERB may very well be the greatest rap lyric of all time).
Nerdcore is what happens when geeks take a real liking to the poetic cleverness of rap music and apply their own obsessive waste of time to it (geeks love clever music, otherwise Weird Al, They Might Be Giants, Arrogant Worms, and Radio Free Vestibule would not have an audience). This can be anything like science, science fiction, history, role-playing games, comic books, anime, any kind of fandom like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, or video games.
As you might guess, it is the only Rap subgenre made entirely by white people. That's not to say that black people can't be geeks, just that geekdom is mostly a function of the forces of education and wealth which skewers away from demographics that are disenfranchised. But then again, most electronic music was made by black geeks, so it's probably a topical thing, not a racial thing. You still have Del.
Nerdcore was probably started by MC Frontalot (unless it wasn't) and it was popularized by mc chris, the Adult Swim alumni who sounds like Chris Tucker huffing a tank of helium.
Nerdcore exists primarily by showing up in other geek properties like The Big Bang Theory or Comic Con (opening for The Barenaked Ladies of course). If you can find a Nerdcore show, just remember the secret words: Klaatu Barada N... necktie... nectar... nickel... noodle. It's an "N" word, it's definitely an "N" word.
Ish.


## Conscious Rap
*aka:  Political Rap, Protest Rap, Underground Hip Hop* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in late 80s

Conscious Rap is a way for a culture to express its concerns over the socio-political climate of its day in an astute and intellectual manner.
Just about anything can be Conscious if given the right context. I figured this out after studying for many years with the wise philosopher Ice-T, who tersely theorized that one must first acquire a moderate level of wealth and privilege and then use it to achieve advantageous positions in politics and media. Then, and only then, shall one obtain the necessary female accompaniment.
If anyone ever complains to you that Rap music is nothing but a bunch of thugs swearing every third word, you can show them this genre (or maybe Nerdcore) as proof that some of it is not. Most Conscious Rap is Rated PG and it rarely has any "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" labels, so it is approved by Leave it to Beaver moms everywhere, but little do they realize that it actually contains the most dangerous and rebellious content: Black people being unapologetically black.




Conscious Rap is the Trojan horse of music genres -- it doesn't say "Fuck Tha Police", it explains to you how law enforcment is woefully inadequate at solving many of today's socio-political issues and the prison-industrial complex is a systematic neo-slavery system that unjustly targets, criminalizes and imprisons young black males to meet the needs of private for-profit institutions, and it can back all that up with evidence, data, and empirical research. And your mom would never know that unless she stops by your room to actually listen to the lyrics for awhile before picking up your clothes on laundry day. But she's not going to do that. Why are your socks always so crusty?
Yes, Conscious Rap is the double threat -- street smarts and book smarts. It has enough complex themes and issues to give a child an education. It uses sophisticated didactic imagery, not lazy pop culture euphemisms. Big words are used compelling kids to grab a dictionary thus expanding their vocabulary (and not in an In Living Color Oswald Bates kind of way, but more like a Calvin & Hobbes kind of way). 

Knowledge is power and Conscious Rap is making you think, realize, act, and revolt. It is the most dangerous thing to white people -- a black man with an education. It doesn't make you angry. It makes you woke.
Or sometimes its just Del rapping about spaceships and elves.
Conscious Rap isn't a regional specific genre. Some artists make it almost exclusively, but for the most part it simply represents a fun challenge for more ambitious rappers, and every hardcore rap album has at least one of these tracks, the way every 80s Heavy Metal album would have that one slow dance ballad (and it was usually the one to chart because what else are they going to play at 80s proms inbetween Tears For Fears and Robert Palmer?).
Lately there has emerged a new form of Conscious Rap that is not conscious at all. In fact, most of it is just complete gibberish. It consists of long multi-syllabic words purged through google dictionary and strung together because they rhyme, they're alliterative or they fit the cadence.
For example, a rapper realizes that a lot of words end in -ation therefore he can use that suffix in an effort to sound intelligent, cryptic, poetic, post-modern or avant-garde (in other words just like Oswald Bates). But in truth it's none of these things. It's the rapper writing his lyrics in MS Word and is abusing the shift-F7 function. If you're a rapper, please stop doing this. You're not being Conscious, you're just spitting nonsense.
Unless you're Del.
Ish.


## Dancehall
*aka:  Dancehall Rap, Ragga Rap, Reggae* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in early 80s

In a way Dancehall is Rap returning to its ancient, archaic, mythological pre-Harlem roots, before rap was Rap and before Hip Hop was anything.
Technically Dancehall is a blunt subgenre of Reggae. But since Dancehall and Dub are the only Reggae genres that can technically be called electronic (and for Dancehall only in the 80s when it acquired some spliffy drum machines and samplers), it doesn't warrant including the whole scene. Sorry, but you must have at least three actual electronic genres to be a scene on this guide. Those are the rules that I just made up.
What a dancehall might look like.
Dancehall evolved out of the gladiatorial soundclashes and mobile soundsystems in early 80s Jamaica where party people would vote with their approval on who the best MCs were, which is a chronic human pastime older than grass. It retains the ancient toastmaster tradition of rapping about absolute nonsense but not stopping. Ever. For any reason. Seriously, the lungs on these people. They just go on and on. It's like they're reading a turgid Ayn Rand novel but in rhyming couplets. And a Jamaican accent (Atlas Smoked?).
Whereas conventional Rap had packed itself into the bowl of verse-bridge-chorus radio friendly formats for mass appeal, Dancehall kept it real/100/authentic/genuine/honest/kosher/pure/dank like a skunk in an elevator. Because in Jamaican toasting tradition, everyone wants to dab on the mic to be King Of The Dance Hall. It's like a totally ripped air guitar contest where endurance matters more than leafy proficiency. And also because Jamaicans constantly bogart the mic.
Next to Scottish and East Indian, Jamaican is the English accent that's the most dope to imitate yet simultaneously the most difficult to imitate well. But the cadence of the accent lends itself well to toasting because it's all about feelin dem bow riddim. Whatever that is.
And this is a dumb aside, but here's a Deep Thought: If you pick-pocketed Usain Bolt and he saw you, would you try to run away? ....why?
Dancehall had a minor toke in the mainstream in the late 80s and early 90s and ironically most of it was not the actual Dancehall genre but Dancehall-style rapping. Hip House, Eurodance, and of course the Superior Jungle To All Other Jungle -- Ragga Jungle -- all explicitly cannibalized toasters from Jamaica. Or rather the Jamaican community in London. The trend did not sticky icky around as things pretty much bonged out by the mid 90s.
As for actual Dancehall charting, there's Sean Paul the Jamaican with a name that sounds like a fashion label and a voice that sounds like a Bollywood song & dance number, Ini Kamoze - Here Comes The Hotstepper, a pop crossover track that found its way onto daytime talk shows and middle school dances. And oh yeah, there's Snow.
The white guy from Toronto.
Ish.


## Rap
*aka:  Freestyling, MCing, Hip Hop* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in mid to late 70s

Rap was invented by black people.
Debbie Harry once made a valiant attempt to try and convince us that white people invented it, but the result came out awkward and weird; a clumsy imitation of an artform she didn't fully understand other than "words rhyme a lot". Which is easy to do when you're rhyming words like car/far/Mars/bars/guitars -- you know, the kind of challenging poetry 8-year-olds come up with. The song is still catchy as all hell.
Rap is one of the four pillars that make up Hip Hop culture (the other three being graffiti, DJing and breakdancing... and a possible fifth pillar: Basketball, along with its sidekick the And1 mixtape) and much like professional sports and the prison industry it is almost completely dominated by African Americans.
Rap's origins can trace back to the toasting traditions in Jamaica.
In the 50s and 60s -- when reggae and Dub songs were sold as 7" singles on 45 -- it was customary for record labels to put the complete song on Side-A and an instrumental version on Side-B. Jamaicans would throw "toasting" parties, a form of karoake where DJs would play the instrumental B-side and volunteers would get on a microphone and improvise their own lyrics.
The person on the mic became known as the "Master of Ceremonies" or MC and their improvisations became known as "freestyling". People who were bad at it stumbled over words, flubbed lines, or couldn't think of anything to say (so just like real karoake). People who were good at it had "flow" -- a type of cadence in voice and inflection that reflected the rhythm of the song, and they got so good at it that they were more than just toastmasters. They were urban oral poets.
In the 1970s, two important things happened:
The SL-1200 direct drive turntable was released by Technics in 1972 and it became the penultimate DJ tool over the next 30 years. Turntables (even direct drive turntables) existed before this time but the key component of the SL series was that you could manipulate the platter with your hand and it wouldn't wreck the motor as was the case with belt-driven turntables (the Beta format of the turntable wars). As soon as you let go, it bounced right back to its regular speed.
What an SL-1200 turntable might look like.
This allowed DJs to use the turntable as an instrument, stopping and starting the music in real time, or even reversing it, or reversing it and forwarding it, or reversing and forwarding and reversing and forwarding over and over really super fast, begetting a new technique called scratching (and giving rise to the ultra technical genre of Turntablism) that is so competitive there is an annual contest called the DMC World Championships to determine who is the best at reversing and forwarding records really super fast.
The other important thing was an economic slump in Jamaica in the early 70s, forcing many of the island's inhabitants to immigrate to better opportunities. Some went to Canada and turned the country into a track & field powerhouse over the next 20 years. Others went to America -- especially some of the best toasters and DJs, and specifically to New York City.
It was in Harlem and The Bronx that Jamaican toasting became Rap, as immigrant MCs shed the Reggae and Dub sounds and tuned in to the new sounds of the Big Apple -- chiefly Funk and Disco. Early Rap records were based on Disco grooves as DJs hooked a mixer to a pair of Tech 12s so they could mix the same 4-bar instrumental bridge off two copies of the same record, playing one while rewinding the other and hopping back and forth, effectively prolonging the song and therefore the rapping. This 'hopping' technique or "Hip Hop" gave the culture its namesake (allegedly).
The industry clued in to what DJs were doing and in an effort to exploit them help them out, record labels began releasing 12" singles on 33 later that decade (8-10 minute extended club mixes of Disco and Funk hits) so DJs didn't have to do all that hip hopping. This allowed latter generations of DJs to be lazier and less skilled than previous generations and more reliant on market forces, a pattern that continues to this day.
In the early 80s, Rap producers and MCs became less dependent on DJs to loop Disco music for them (because that costs money) and started using the new drum machines that were hitting the market, specifically the Roland TR-808 which was originally intended as a click track device for guitar bands too lame to hire a real drummer. It was rejected by the rock industry for not sounding anything like real drums. But it has a delicious, deep bassy kick which singlehandedly launched the genres of Electro and Technobass.
What a TR-808 might look like.
The TR-808 did not initially sell well, relegating it to the bargain bins of second hand music stores and consignment shops. From there it found a second life in the hands of eager and enthusiastic Rap producers with meager and unenthusiastic budgets (the ones who couldn't afford a drum machine beat-boxed, which is both awesome and sad at the same time. It's like a high finance investor with no money pretending to play the stock market).
Later in the 80s things got even easier for Rap producers when digital samplers arrived, especially the E-mu SP-1200 released in 1987. Now Rap producers could return to the Funk, Soul, R&B and Disco sounds of their youth, pillaging drum breaks and looping them in samplers, effectively creating entire songs (and in some cases entire albums) with just one piece of gear and four seconds of actual music. It became really easy to make Rap music at this point, and the scene fractured into regional fiefdoms.
Finding examples of the earliest Rap music in the 70s is tricky since the decade was almost over before anyone thought that future generations might be interested in what they were rapping about. So it's not like Rap didn't exist in the early 70s insomuch as people simply didn't record any. This was partly because Rap was initially regarded as a live music format, and the energy of the live performance could never be captured and recorded properly. So even though we don't have any evidence, Kool Herc insists that's what he was doing at the time.
But probably a better reason is the only people rapping were poor black youth in Harlem and the South Bronx and they just didn't have the means to create record labels and sell music. All they did was master talking really fast. Coming up with a detailed business strategy on how to market their music to the masses was beyond their expertise (not to mention sacreligious, in a way).
It was only when an outsider -- Sylvia Robinson, mogul for All Platinum Records -- took an interest in what she heard at a Manhattan night club, that the genre got its first big break. On inspiration she decided to make a record with the first three street kids she could find who talked really fast, and that's how the Sugarhill Gang -- a manufactured studio outfit -- was born.
A more poetic argument suggests that Rap didn't officially start until July 13-14, 1977 -- the date of the infamous New York City blackout. For almost two whole days the largest city on Earth was without power and its inhabitants reverted to a subsistance based lifestyle (like Mad Max, but with less desert and football pads).
The city's inner city residents took advantage of this unique opportunity to embrace radical consumerism, and many aspiring rappers and producers looted music stores for coveted mixing boards and DJ equipment. And we know this happened because those same rappers and DJs have admitted as such.
Suddenly almost overnight the city was awash with Rap music, labels, records, and charting performances. Now I'm not saying correlation implies causation, but you can't deny that the blackout certainly helped get the means into the right hands. A music industry was born out of the darkness of the night.
So it can't be said that Rap had officially arrived as an industry until the 1980s, but I like to use the landmark year of 1972 as a starting point because Rap didn't really become Rap until the DJ could lay down a sick groove for the MC to chatter incessantly over. And he can't do that without Tech-12s.
The first Rap song to chart was aforementioned Sugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight in 1979, which was really just a gang of toasters freestyling for 15 minutes over the same groove of Chic's Good Times. A lot of the earliest Rap music was party music, so the lyrics were about partying and having a good time, with no lasting substance or malicious content.

Listen to The Party Rap Mix of the earliest and greatest Rap records.
	

That all changed with Grandmaster Flash - The Message. Released in 1982, it marked a sharp change of direction from the happy-go-lucky lyrical content of Kurtis Blow and Sugar Hill Records. It was a raw, uncompromising portrayal of the realities of inner city life, an anthem of Reagan America's vicious economic assault on its own people.
After this point, Rap's archaic age was over, as new technologies and ideas split it into several subgenres, some based on esthetics (like Turntablism, Conscious Rap or even Nerdcore) but most emerging on their own (Eastcoast, Westcoast, Southern). Together, along with Rap proper, these became known as Gangsta Rap by the end of the 80s.
Thug life took over the Hip Hop scene in an important way. The positive, feelgood oldskool party sound was well and done away with, and didn't much survive the decade.
Ish.



## Eastcoast Rap
*aka:  Gangsta Rap, Reality Rap, Political Rap* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in mid 80s

Eastcoast Rap only came to be called Eastcoast Rap when the other coasts started making Rap music. You can decide at any time in the 80s when a distinctive Eastcoast sound emerged, but a good gauge is to identify it as anything that doesn't sound like Electro or Disco. Or you can say it started with Russell Simmons and Def Jam Recordings, and Run DMC. Or if you're white, the Beastie Boys.
The rest of society was probably introduced to Rap through ancillary media like The Cosby Show.

I enjoy the Cosby Show the same way I enjoy Michael Jackson: With measured resolve.
	

Of the three Gangsta genres, Eastcoast was the most conscious and militant. Rap music has always been inextricably linked with the socio-political climate of its day, so it was an inevitable consequence of the 80s that rappers would incorporate themes of unrest and economic injustice against the backdrop of a political pogrom that aggressively disenfranchised them.
Politics in the 80s were instrumental in Gangsta Rap's development so I need to go on a bit of an aside here:
When Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, he reformed the government into an apparatus that served only people like him (ie: old, rich and white) to the exclusion of everyone else. Reagan's government hired economic thinkers to tell them what they wanted to hear: That if they gave themselves more money and power they will share it with everyone else (spoiler: they didn't).
This new strategy -- voodoo, trickle down, supply side, whatever you want to call it -- compared the average American to a filthy mongrel wimpering beneath the dinner table, consuming the unhealthy fat and gristle that the rich were gracious enough to drop on the floor. The wealthy fed America just enough table scraps to keep them alive but too weak, stupid and malnutritioned to do anything about it.
35 years later and the American people are starving so much that they actually elected an orange Cheeto under the assumption that they could eat it.
This plan had harsh consequences in the ghettos and inner cities all over America. The poorest, the youngest, and of course the most visible minorities were strangled by these new economic policies; their opportunities for advancement shuttered, their few remaining avenues for sustenance cancelled, moved, outsourced, laid off, or ignored.
As High America raced forward with new forms of speculative wealth, the underclasses were marginalized and forgotten, left to themselves to fester and rot in decrepit urban prisons as mini-third world countries bereft of opportunity and advancement. And then along came crack.
Not to say that the ghettos and inner cities were drug-free utopias smelling like lemon-scented Febreze before crack came around. But it didn't help things. Reagan and crack upgrayedd a slow burning fuse into a TNT-charged powderkeg. It was only natural that the cultural expression of the time would evolve into something raw, real, and more antagonizing as the 80s made African American lives more destitute.
Out of desperation comes new art. It happened with Jazz, it happened with Blues, and it happened with Rap. The black man is the fountainhead of American cultural progress.
Eastcoast Rap can be separated into two waves. The first wave was the Def Jam era in the 80s, dressed in Adidas, black hats, and gold chains carrying a boombox, to such an extent that it has since become the ubiquetous 80s Rap uniform. You go to a costume party as an 80s rapper, you're gonna look like this:
It's either this or a viking helmet.
The second wave was the Wu-Tang and Bad Boy era of the 90s, almost exclusively as a reaction to the intense, Ruthless Westcoast variant of Gangsta. These two coasts bickered often, sometimes in public, sometimes even at Awards Shows, and usually accompanied by a thrown chair. Because a thrown chair always starts shit -- it's a biological fact.

Some moments you just can't let slide.
	

In the end two rappers were dead (their deaths making them much better rappers than they really were), several more jailed, and the South was brought in as a mediator.
Eventually Eastcoast Rap came to its senses and argued that it couldn't reasonably sell the ghetto Gangsta lifestyle when it had made so much money doing so. Wealth and success compelled Rap music to stop rapping about being on the street, and start rapping about owning the street.
Ish.


## Bling
*aka:  Gangsta Rap* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in late 90s

Rap spent the 80s and 90s making a lot of money complaining about how life was tough. Bling Rap is about complaining that having a lot of money makes life tough.
The merging of the three regional Gangsta genres into one dominant millenial one is a function of the forces of the Internet. When the producer is from the west coast (Dr. Dre), the vocalist is from the east coast (Rihanna), and the rapper is from the Midwest (Eminem), do coastal beefs really matter anymore?
Boasting about one's exploits has always been a staple of Hip Hop culture although the subtle gradation into more base urges over the decades is evident. Its misogyny has always been a problem, but whereas in the 80s Rap was about loving the ladies, in the 90s it was about pimping bitches, and in the 00s it was about hoes in different area codes.
Rap's portrayal of drugs also got fierce: In the 80s it was "stay away from drugs", in the 90s it was "sell drugs", and now it's "I'm on drugs" (props Crank Lucas). Some rappers are so high they can't even rap properly which is why there is now an emerging subgenre called 'mumblerap' which is just harmonized guttural utterances (all hypeman and no rap); a combination of Lil' Jon's locker room war whoops and 50 Cent's mushmouth incoherence.
And since I've brought up 50 Cent, I guess now is the appropriate time to talk about the epidermoid cyst that is Kanye West. In a way, Kanye is all our fault. We did this. We made him. Let me explain.
Kanye has resting Kanye face.
See, for his first couple albums Kanye had this scrappy underdog vibe. Great production esthetics, terrible lyrics. An absolute moron in interviews. But he was somewhat conscious and Conscious Rap was never big. Gangsta/Bling dominated the charts for over a decade and at the top of this pyramid was 50 Cent.
Kanye and 50 Cent represented polar opposite attitudes in music: The clean cut, family-friendly middle class artist baring his soul against the thuggish, big evil scary black heavily-tattooed former drug dealer gangsta who got shot seven times.
In a watershed moment that almost never happens in any music let alone Rap music, Kanye and 50 released albums on the same day: September 11, 2007. Kanye's Graduation vs 50's Curtis. They planned this: They were going toe to toe against each other for Rap supremacy.
And, well, Kanye won. By, like, a lot.
Much like when Nirvana crushed Guns n Roses heralding a shift in music from Metal to Grunge, so too did Kanye signify a changing of the guard. He wrestled Bling away from Gangsta into its own thing, that in addition to ostentatious wealth it would also be introspective, emotional, and soul-searching -- almost art. Mo money, mo problems.
It also didn't hurt that Kanye sampled Daft Punk's sample of Edwin Birdsong, tapping an as-yet unclaimed market: White urban hipsters.
Kanye soundly defeating 50 Cent was a statement. He was no longer the underdog. Now he was the alpha. The trendsetter. The man to beat. And of course he let it go to his head.
In subsequent albums the more Ye bled his soul the more immature is Ye content, like a selfish child who can't understand why he doesn't get everything he wants on demand. Because while Ye can do emotional, Ye cannot do intellectual as Ye does not know a lot about things, and by that I mean Ye is functionally ignorant in a manner that belies his intelligence.
I can never tell who's more full of shit -- Kanye West or my dog six hours after it swipes my big bean burrito -- but it was a mistake to think that Kanye was some kind of eccentric genius on par with Bjork or Andre 3000. He's not playing 14-dimensional chess. He's just a whiny, self-absorbed narcissist dangerously reaching Roger Waters levels.
And we have no one but ourselves to blame. It's like one of those monkey paw wishes that comes with a terrible curse.
If you want one more reason to hate Kanye, it's because of him that we now have Drake, who is basically a more educated, more polite Kanye with less exceptionalism.
The only good thing that can be said about Drake is that he's Canadian. That means there won't be any others because only one Canadian rap artist can be famous at a time. This is known as the Maestro Fresh Wes Law.
Recently Bling has somewhat merged with Trap, with the sole difference being that Bling rappers still rap about things. Or at least try to.

## Westcoast Rap
*aka:  Gangsta Rap, Reality Rap, G-Funk* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in late 80s

Westcoast Rap was because NWA wanted to look like Run DMC and sound like Public Enemy.
The earliest forms of Westcoast Rap were actually Electro and Funk based, like something you might see at a Morris Day and the Time concert. Things changed with Ruthless Records and Eazy-E (a real gangsta) and his friends Dr. Dre and Ice Cube (not real gangstas) who depicted a harsher, more depressing reality than the politically conscious Eastcoast variant. Less "fight the power" and more "my life is fraught with peril and I'll probably die at a young age". Which wasn't true, otherwise there'd be a lot more gang-related rapper deaths.
The reality was probably far less interesting -- lazy days full of unemployment and smoking weed rather than drive by shootings and huge drug hustles. In other words: More like Friday and less like Boyz n the Hood. Unfortunately it's the thug life that sells Raiders jackets and baseball caps so Gangsta Rap was marketed as something daring and adventurous to 11-year old middle class white kids smoking their first cigarette.
NWA's depiction of gang life and violence caught the imagination of boring, suburban America where the most dangerous thing happening is a dog off leash at a kid's waterpark. NWA chronicled their struggle against oppression with their plea-to-sanity hit song "I Am Not Fond of Law Enforcement", a well-spoken and thought-provoking treatise of urban poetry that stated its intentions clearly: Black America was quite upset at being profiled, arrested, beaten, harrassed, imprisoned and fined simply for trying to eke out a casual existence.
NWA's message resonated well with authorities who responded to the terrible plight of the African-American community with more police, more beatings, more crackdowns, tougher laws, longer sentences and token platitudes to deal with the problem but not actually doing it. Rap music was banned, gangs were encouraged to solve themselves, and children were told rather insultingly to "Just Say No". Treating the symptoms rather than the cause. Or, in more literal terms, blaming the poor for the rich having all the money.
Everything came to a head with the Rodney King incident. Not even crack cocaine could convince African-Americans that life was ever going to get better. In April and May of 1992, thousands of NWA fans set Los Angeles on fire. For several months afterward the whole city was high-strung with racial anxiety. It was conceivable that the next angry Gangsta Rap album might motivate the black community to torch the city again.
But instead this happened.

Probably the most important thing to ever happen not just to Rap music, but to American culture. Recorded just a month after after the riots, The Chronic was the right album at the right time: A return to Westcoast Rap's ancient (and quite forgotten in the wake of Gangsta's massive success -- does no one remember Chris 'The Glove' Taylor?) Electro and Funk roots.
Dr. Dre's newly christend "G-funk" sound was a hazy, laidback, marijuana-tinged California vibe with Zapp-based farting basslines and the perfect frontman: Snoop Dogg, who's "I smoked too much weed" lazy drawl carried a much-needed subtext of "Everyone just chill the fuck out. Let's collect ourselves together, smoke a bowl and relax." It's also really funny, begetting a trend in Rap to not take itself too seriously. Especially the diss records.
The Chronic did not end poverty, crime or resolve African-American relations with the police. But it at least convinced folks that rioting was not going to solve anything. Also: The therapeutic benefits of marijuana.
The Eastcoast-Westcoast beef was probably started by Suge Knight (pronounced Shoog Kan-niggit) of Death Row Records. Who knows how much of the beef was legit and how much was just show business kayfabe, but knowing Suge Knight..... well, he probably didn't know what he was doing half the time as long as it looked gangsta. Even in the days before social media it was easy to get cheap PR by being a dinknugget, so diss records and Awards Show boasts became a big part of every Rap label's marketing arsenal.
Much like the Southern scene's obsession with bass, the Gangsta scene was obsessed with chillin'. Hence names like Ice-T, Ice Cube, Ice D, Ice One, Ice Lord, Ice City, Ice Train, Ice-Y, Ice Water, Ice Cold, Ice Pack, Ice Berg, Ice Cream, Ice Capades, Ice Sickel, Ice Doggy Dogg, Ice Rink, Icey Hot Stuntaz, I See Ice, Ice 9, Vanilla Ice, Black Ice, Dry Ice, Cats & mIce, twIce as nIce, Mike tIce-in, Hot n spIcey Soup, Jesus ChrIce, and of course Niggas Wit Slurpee Brain Freeze.
Just like the other Gangsta genres, G-Funk was consumed by its own success. It's hard to rap about the gritty world of the streets when you're decked out in designer fashions and gaudy jewelry while pulling up to the mansion in tricked out 6-figure cars. So it stopped rapping about the gritty world of the streets, and started rapping about being decked out in designer fashions and gaudy jewelry while pulling up to the mansion in tricked out 6-figure cars. Enter: Bling.
Ish.


## Southern Rap
*aka:  Gangsta Rap, Southern Hip Hop, Dirty South Rap* in the Hip Hop scene, emerged in late 80s

People from the north did not initially consider Rap from the south to be real Rap. They thought it was silly corny Rap that had not yet matured into something conscious and intellectual the way "real" Rap had. Especially that Miami Bass stuff which sometimes didn't even have any rapping, or that Dirty South stuff which was just juvenile audio smut.
So the original rappers did not think highly of the Southern scene. It was like your friend's bratty little brother who tries to impress you with fart and poop jokes. While the Eastcoast was rapping about the struggle and economic oppression, the South was rapping about big butts (and 30 years later nothing has changed).
Thus begins the lesser known of the great coastal beefs: The Eastcoast-Southcoast beef. Fortunately no one was killed, mostly because it's hard to bust a cap in a moving target and Southern booties never stop shaking.
I make a distinction between Southern Rap and Dirty South Rap (a demarcation that doesn't really exist) because Southern Rap is at least an attempt to rap about something other than partying and sex (namely drugs, crime, and being an OG nigga, the same shit everyone else raps about).
Southern Rap was not from Miami, or even from much of Florida. I think its most southern stronghold was Orlando, but it was represented best by the Deep South states and cities like New Orleans (home of No Limit Records -- you can credit Master P for putting the "respect" in "respect Southern Rap music, please"), Atlanta and Houston (home of Cash Money Records which eventually gave us Bling). Or even Memphis (home of Elvis and Three 6 Mafia -- just imagine those two on stage together). Because America is a big-ass country and Rap music is occurring everywhere, not just the coasts.
Musicwise, Southern Rap did not add anything new. It sounds unmistakeably like Westcoast or Eastcoast Rap depending on which is more popular at the time. When Eastcoast blew up with its sample-heavy breaks and militant lyrics, Southern sounded like that. When Westcoast blew up with its hazy G-funk, Southern sounded like that. It's almost impossible to locate any unique musical identity in Southern Rap in the 80s and 90s, and if you didn't look up the artists on Discogs you'd have assumed they were from New York or Los Angeles. They even hid their dialects to sound like the other coasts.
But Southern Rap did contribute one valuable thing to Hip Hop culture: Pen & Pixel, the infamous graphics design firm out of Houston that did not understand the meaning of the word "overkill".
Operated by two white jewish dudes, Pen & Pixel cranked out thousands of album covers for mostly independent Southern rappers in the 90s. The covers were gaudy, busy, unintentionally ludicrous, and highly desired for their ability to snow crash your brain. By looking at them you can tell that the rapper had a great deal of input in the design process and no suggestion was ever refused.
Imagine what their brainstorm sessions were like. The rapper would tell the designers:
"Okay, yo -- check this shit out. I want my album cover to have my name all decked out, like covered in diamonds n gold n shit. Cuz I'm tha pimp and I'm all about stackin' that paper. I want me and my dawg on the cover, and we're at the beach smokin' phat blunts, and I want a stripper hangin' upside down on the pole like it ain't no thang, and I want a mountain of weed, like giant nugs of dank bud that we gon' smoke right after, and I want my ride poppin' its hydraulics and roaring over the weed mountain. With a license plate that says "weed" on it. And I want my guitar on the cover -- gotta have my strings wit me knowwhadamsayin? And my bong. My bong on the cover too. And some palm trees. And money. Just have us all standing in front of a giant dollar bill. And make sure everything is made of gold, even the sky."
Pen & Pixel: "Done."
Needs more dogs, glocks, women, gold chains, cigars, watches, champagne, hos, lens flares, graffiti, luxury cars, yachts, bitches, cash money, apocalyptic wastelands, and the artist dressed like a mafia don.
Rapper: "Okay, listen up -- we da Big Ballaz and we need to reprazent, knowhadamsayin? Now, I want the most fly palace you can think of, like a place that's so dope you couldn't imagine anyone living there."
Pen &  Pixel: "How about a cathedral?"
Rapper: Yeah, ya feels me. Now, I want the cathedral just full o' money. Like, cash stacked up halfway to the ceiling like Scrooge's money bin but like hunnerd dollah billz. And also watches, jewels, bracelets, just valuables all over. And it's all mint condition too, cuz we ain't no street hustlaz. Also put in bottles of our own brand of champagne, because that's how we roll. And a cell phone so we can stay on top of the game. And cigars cuz all we do is win. And a pineapple."
Pen &  Pixel: "Done and do--wait, did you say pineapple?"
Rapper: "Yeah, pineapples are da shit, y0."
Pen &  Pixel: "Done."
"Don't forget the pineapple."
For a good hour of fun, GIS Pen & Pixel. It cannot be emphasised enough how important this style of art was to the cultural evolution of the three Gangsta Rap genres into Bling. That coincided with the Southern Rap realization that their real strength was the bass so they should stop trying so hard to sound like other scenes. So around 2000 they cultivated their rich Miami Bass heritage into something that came to dominate all rap everywhere.
It's a classic Disney rags-to-riches story. Or maybe a tepid JRPG: The struggling Rap genre that was initially shunned and devalued as not real Rap grows up to displace the great Rap powers from their self-entitlement, without forsaking its values or convictions. That's inspirational. In the great beef between Eastcoast and Westcoast, the South won.
Yes, the South won something. First time in 150 years.
Ish.

# Bass

## Trap
*aka:  Turn Down For What* in the Bass scene, emerged in early 10s

Trap was a short-lived subgenre successor to Crunk that emerged around 2010 or 2011 (or possibly earlier) depending on who you ask.
It differed from Crunk in that the aggressive call and response lyrics and rapping were mostly absent, replaced by super busy snare fills, breakdowns and builds, and hi-hat percussion over 808 bass kicks. That's comforting. 30 years later and the 808 is still the standard.
The word 'trap' comes from Atlanta drug slang and is a reference to where you put your drugs, where you sell your drugs, or how you stash your money from drugs, making it a noun as well as a verb, as versatile as 'smurf'. It's called 'trap' because once you get in the cycle of poverty and crime it is impossible to get out.
According to some purists, Trap can only be music from Atlanta that raps exclusively about the stuggle in Atlanta, which is such a narrow definition it's hardly useful. That makes it barely a thing much less a micro-genre. Fortunately we know this is wrong because instrumental Trap has been around for as long as someone labeled it Trap.
Like the subgenre Snap that preceded it (a subgenre so called for using snapping fingers instead of claps), Trap was a simple gimmick that utilized the Crunk template to attempt some snare-driven Dubstep style drops. In the underground it was a short-lived fad and already by the midpoint of 2012 it had worn out its welcome, following in the wake of the Dubstep crash as a curious novelty.
By the end of 2012 Trap was dead. Or presumed dead. Or assumed dead. Or should have been dead. It was supposed to be dead.
And then this happened:

The original is actually quite tame compared to its copycats
	

It is hard to explain precisely the revolution of a phenomenon from the perspective of the underground in a way that makes sense to the mainstream. Youtube had already demonstrated its immense power over culture with the Rebecca Black phenomenon in 2011 and the Gangnam Style phenomenon in the summer of 2012 (and if you're wondering what genre Psy is, he's biting LMFAO style Fidget House). So we were already well prepared for it happening to any insignificant form of music for any particular reason (well, 4chan might be the reason, but it wouldn't be a good reason).
The actual track by Baauer (a white guy from Philadelphia which automatically makes his meme hit not Trap according to black guys from Atlanta) hit the clubs in the summer of 2012 -- the tail end of the Trap fad. But the Harlem Shake phenomenon itself didn't happen until February 2013, long after the track's life cycle.
Why this specific track at this specific time, who knows. If we had a decent understanding of human psychology, groupthink and memes, marketers would have bottled and sold it by now. I mean, could anyone have foreseen the popularity of "cash me outside howbowdah"? What even is that?
Behold the Harlem Shake jump cut.
Harlem Shake videos were the perfect storm of viral propagation: They were short, easy to film, they required group participation which social media was best at, and anyone could do them but the best ones had planning, preparation and foresight so they stood out. Within a month parodies and copycats flooded Youtube, most of them with barely any understanding of Trap music or what they were even supposed to be doing. Like ripples in a pond, each wave of participants copies the wave before it until the signal gets weaker and more distorted the further it gets from the source.
Harlem Shake videos were made by Saturday Night Live, ESPN, the army, every late night talk show, and even the Republican Party for fuck's sakes and those guys are whiter than wonder bread. The Harlem Shake was even a couch gag on the Simpsons. It was performed by sky divers, playboy bunnies, every professional sports team, on roofs, on buses, underwater, in locker rooms, and of course universities. A lot of university dorms tried to one-up each other in Harlem Shake videos. It was the Millenial flash mob.
But it did revive Trap music and in response Crunk producers went back to the Trap template to cut new tracks. We are still in this era today. The Turn Down For What era. This is your jam. You own this. The Boomers had John Lennon, the Gen-Xers had Kurt Cobain, and who do you got? Albus Dumbledore?
Ish.


## Crunk
*aka:  Snap, Crunkcore, Bass Rap* in the Bass scene, emerged in mid 90s

In 1993 Conan O'Brien and Andy Richter were scheming ways to get past the TV censors on Conan's late night talk show and they settled on an all-purpose suitable replacement for the infamous seven dirty swearwords that they couldn't say on TV: Crunk.
The choice to use that word was definitely not random. Ice-T just happened to be on the show that night so he probably fed the word to them beforehand, and they built a skit out of it and kept saying it as a running gag throughout the telecast. Every time something happened they would use the word as an expletive -- "That was seriously crunked up, right there."
But Ice-T never claimed to have come up with the word. He probably got it from Dirty South rappers who had been using it for years as a euphemism for getting really crazy and fucked up on marijuana and alcohol: Stoned and drunk. Chronic plus Drunk = Crunk. Or maybe it was crack and drunk. Or cocaine and drunk (but not codeine because that's not crunk, that's drank). Or maybe just being crazy and drunk.
Whatever it is, it means getting really crazy and fucked up on inebriants that at least number more than one -- "We're gonna get crunked tonight" was the new "let's get fucked up". And with Conan's introduction of the word to northern suburban audiences, Crunk came into its own as the recognized sound of the new generation of Dirty South Rap.
At least, that's how the story goes. It probably had no relation or impact whatsoever.
In truth, you can probably blame Three 6 Mafia for taking Dirty South Rap to the next level. They introduced something that had a slower beat than most Bass music, less raunchy lyrics for commercial appeal, aggressive call and responses, and oh yeah -- they won an Oscar. It was for a song that had nothing to do with Crunk (It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp) I just think it's amusing that for a brief while Three 6 Mafia had more Oscars than Martin Scorsese.
As for Crunk, it had a healthy scene years before there was a serious national conversation about it. The event that really punched it into the mainstream was Season 2 of Chappelle's Show in 2004. Dave Chappelle's portrayal of Lil' Jon going through everyday life as the ultimate hype man -- yelling his way through mundane tasks -- convinced legions of white college fratboys everywhere to wander around hollaring "HWHAT! O-KAAY! YEEEAH!!" like annoying dipshits.
And that's how you get bullshit like this:
Emo Punk kidz doing Crunk. This is what happens to your music scene if you don't gatekeep it at least a little.
Historically speaking white people have always ruined black things but Brokencyde's special brand of Crunkcore (defined as "what if Slipknot anally raped Three Six Mafia") is a gloriously gilded fountain of rat diarrhea. And once they're in it's hard to kick them out. They must be extracted slowly, painfully, like winching a guinea worm from your ankle. Let this be another lesson in the perils of mainstreamization.
For three or four glorious years, Crunk ruled the airwaves. If you want to bookend this era, you can say it started with Lil' Jon - Get Low and ended with Soulja Boy - Crank That. And it's fitting that Soulja Boy ended Crunk Because Soulja Boy ends everything. But the mainstream, always slow on the uptake, didn't get the memo and before long you have Saturday Night Live in 2009 making fun of a genre that stopped being popular in 2007 and was hottest in 2003.

Autotune The News didn't help things either.
	

There is another subgenre of Crunk called Snap which sounds indistinguishable from Crunk except that it likes to use snapping fingers in place of claps or snares. It didn't get popular while another subgenre -- Trap -- did. Why Trap and not Snap? Read the Trap genre to find out (spoiler: Who the hell knows).
By the end of the decade, Crunk was no longer important. It had been supplanted by Dirty South Rap v3: Trap. At least we can say it didn't take 12 years to come up with a v3.
Ish.


## Dirty South Rap
*aka:  Miami Bass, Booty Bass, Bass Rap* in the Bass scene, emerged in mid 80s

Miami Bass with raunchy lyrics.
The weather in South Florida is much nicer than the weather in New York. Rap parties in Harlem or the South Bronx would either be indoors, in studio lofts or clubs, or outdoors like Kool Herc's block parties or in a local park someplace, but either way everyone is relatively clothed (especially in the winter). They're probably even wearing layers.
Miami and West Palm Beach don't have this problem, so parties are normally in the sunny outdoors or in open air venues and everyone is wearing barely anything. Bikinis and hot pants, baggy shorts and airy t-shirts. There is a lot more skin showing, and that means sex appeal, so rappers are going to rap about what they see right there in front of them, and if they can get that woman to twerk just a little bit harder, they are doing their jobs. At least, that's my theory.
Dirty South Rap evolved almost exclusively around the desire to see titties and booties bounce at parties. And who can fault them for that? Rapping about sex was not a new thing, but Dirty South Rap took it to a level of almost kind of parody.
The lyrics were pornographic, the videos raunchy and exploitative, and the endless wars against Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (the group that invented the "Parental Advisory Explicit Content" label) sparked a national conversation about censorship and entertainment in the 80s.
It might as well have said "Cool awesome music inside!"
The artists won, of course, because nothing compels a child to want something more than telling them that they're not allowed to have it. Demonstrating an early version of the Streisand Effect, the "Parental Advisory" label was a giant attention grabber to underage customers that this was something daring and edgy that someone can use to show to their friends.
And that is how 2 Live Crew took over white suburbia. The music didn't do it, the rapping didn't do it, and as much as I love Luke Campbell, he didn't do it. White puritan bedwetters did it to themselves. It had the same effect as an anti-drug officer visiting your elementary school to teach you about the dangers of drugs you didn't know existed until he told you about them and their wonderful effects and how much they cost and where to get them.
Yes, Dirty South Rap is crude and misogynistic but it's also hilariously efficient. There are a billion songs out there about romantic love, and the ultimate expression of love is sex. Dirty South Rap cuts through the middle steps and gets to the heart of every love song: It's about fucking. It's all about fucking. It's always been about fucking. The standard pop song length is 3:20 for a reason: It's the exact length of an average sex act (with two choruses, a bridge and a climax). So why be coy and talk around the issue when you can simply state your intentions openly?
The honesty of Dirty South Rap evades the miscommunication, the close calls, the subtle head games and suggestive glances and the will-they-or-won't-they psychological posturing and maneuvering, and goes straight for the consummation. It knows what it wants, and it doesn't play games. You have to admire it for that. We could all learn something about mating and courtship rituals from the upfront brashness of Dirty South Rap.
The South Florida scene is only so big, so when a new style or sound is invented, everyone tends to move in that direction at once, retiring the previous genre for good. Such that Dirty South Rap was pretty much done when Crunk came around, and likewise the same thing happened to Crunk when TTrap came around.
Ish.


## Miami Bass
*aka:  Bass, Ghetto Bass* in the Bass scene, emerged in mid 80s

The Roland TR-808 drum machine doesn't have a kickdrum.
Instead it has a BassDrum. It's not as warm as the TR-909 nor as infectious as the LinnDrum, and it can't be tuned and it has no MIDI or swing option. But when tweaked just right it can bellow out a teeth-rattling low register note that make da cars go BOOOOOOOM.
It was a happy feature of a device that Roland obviously conducted zero market research for, in that the first run of these units actually had a longer decay time which meant it was even more bass-heavy. Subsequent releases "fixed" the decay issue because Roland didn't think to ask anybody why they would need that much bass in their drum kicks. 
Little did Roland realize that to residents of South Florida there is no such thing as too much bass. When producers wanted more out of the machine, they took to opening it up and fiddling around with the factory default settings (Richie Hawtin did this once and the result was Spastik). Those who were more electronically inclined took a soldering gun to the circuit board to tune the kick circuit and increase the decay time to the point of self-oscillation (it's not hard to do that -- the instructions are right here).

A much better method is to use a sampler. When the E-mu SP-1200 came out in 1987, artists would sample the 808's bassdrum and then manipulate it far beyond the limitations of the original drum machine (sustain it for several seconds, play it at different pitches, that sort of thing). This opened up new opportunities in the emergent genre of Miami Bass.
There is no way to understate this. Three entire scenes, thirteen genres of music in this guide alone, millions of records and thousands of artists along with whole commercial industries of audio speaker manufacturers, car tuner culture, music store demo displays, and music festival sound checks owe their entire existence not to a machine but to a simple knob on a machine.

That's it. That little knob. Simply crank it all the way to the right and get ready to scrub da ground. In fact, let's do that right now. This music is fun.

Make some noise for the Splack Pack.
	

Electro was the first genre to fall in love with the TR-808 but Miami Bass was the first genre to crank that knob and blow out subwoofers and speakers everywhere. Although it was technically a southern take on Rap, Miami Bass was never about the rapping. Lyrics were simple, unintellectual base urges (pun intended), in some cases nothing more than grunts or call-and-responses.
When it did aspire toward something of substance, Miami Bass couldn't think of anything to talk about other than partying and sex, giving rise to Dirty South Rap which is by all accounts absolutely hilarious. You could call it distasteful and misogynistic but how could it be when the women are just as raunchy?
Every so often a Miami Bass track will hit the mainstream charts for a while. It happened with consistent regularity in the 90s. Sir Mix-a-Lot - Baby Got Back, Tag Team - Whoomp! There It Is (which is technically a ripoff of 95 South - Whoot, There It Is), Quad City DJs - Space Jam although that's Michael Jordan's fault, Baha Men - Who Let The Dogs Out which is itself a cover of an Anslem Douglas calypso original, and has since become the official anthem of embarrassing your black coworkers at the office Christmas party. There's also Peanut Butter Jelly Time, but that's mostly because of a Flash meme of a dancing banana.
It's odd that this success is not sustainable and there is no real followup, but I guess now with Trap and bass-heavy Rap dominating everything, Miami Bass doesn't really fill a niche anymore. You may still find the odd track here and there but today Miami Bass is like the Latin language: No one really plays it anymore but its powerful influence lives on in successor genres.
Ish.


## Moombahton
*aka:  Moombah* in the Bass scene, emerged in late 00s

Moombahton is one more attempt to get white people to like Latin rhythms, which is kind of like giving Buffalo Bill one more chance to save the girl in his basement.
You'd think an entire scene almost completely developed and fostered in South Florida would naturally have more Latin influences. Latin culture did influence electronic music in a lot of important ways, but not the Bass scene. Moombahton is the exception.
Moombahton is one of the few genres that can trace its origins -- and its name -- to a single record. In 2009 Silvio Ecomo & Chuckie released a track called "Moombah!" which was nothing special -- typical uncreative cheesy Dutch nonsense (where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular).
However on the B-side was a remix by Afrojack that had a bouncey Latin cadence and a reggae-tinged squeaky horn lead. This made it feel far more ethnic than it had to be, and its bass-heavy kick made it essential for Southern consumption. While Afrojack inadvertently started the genre, the guy who really caned it into prominence was DC native Dave Nada so blame him for everything.
"It's all my fault and there's nothing you can do about it."
Moombahton is also one of the genres to lead the anti-anthem craze.
At some point in the 2000s people were getting sick of the breakdown-build-anthem template in electronic music. It was formulaic, obvious, and a cheap way to get people screaming and jumping and holding their arms in the air rather than actually dancing. So some producers thought they would throw the crowd a curve ball at the moment of climax, something unexpected that the people hadn't already heard in a thousand paint-by-numbers tracks: The anti-anthem.
The anti-anthem is the exact opposite of the anthem. The track keeps the breakdown and build structure but there's no explosive crescendo. It just rolls out into something weak and non-energetic, sometimes nothing more than a kick and a synthline. It was the anti-crescendo.
At first people thought it was a mistake, like the DJ fader-slammed to a different track at the wrong time (some DJs have used this misconception to legitimately cut to soft rock tracks as a troll. One of the more famous trolls is to cut to Spandau Ballet - True. Incidentally, if you are a DJ, don't do this. It's dumb).
Why the name Moombahton? Probably because the beat is lifted wholesale from Reggaeton, an Urban genre that emerged in the early 2000s. That's basically what Moombahton is: Dutch House with Reggaeton rhythms and 808 bass kicks. It was a brief fad that wore out by 2012 and probably should have been forgotten, but then Iggy Azalea and Jennifer Lopez jumped on the Moombahton bandwagon so I guess this form of music is going to stick around for awhile.
There are a number of Moombahton subgenres that exist. None of them are very important yet.
Ish.


## Technobass
*aka:  Electrobass, Audio Bass, Ghetto Bass* in the Bass scene, emerged in late 80s

Technobass is Miami Bass without the Miami.
Keeping the Electro fetish for Kraftwerk and Afrika Bambaataa but refusing to turn down the 808 bassdrum, Technobass was the first Bass genre to leave South Florida and pilgrimmage to the Holy Land of Detroit for consecration. For this reason it is both an Electro genre and a Bass genre, but I can only put it in one location.
Technobass grew into its own as a worthy companion to -- not a replacement of -- Electro. The artist who really pushed Technobass as a thing was Dynamix II, while everyone else had some pun on 'bass' in their name: Bass Cube, Bass Quake, Bass Transformer, Bass Jumper, Bassment, Bassball, Safebass, Suitbass, Kim Bassinger, Leather & Bass, Back to Bassics, Off To The Basses, Acid Bass Reaction (that one's got a 303 in it), Turkey Basster, Rumblebasshead, Largemouth Bass, Ace of Bass, All Your Base Are Belong To Bass, Sebasstian von Basswipe the Bass, Bassically a Bass of Bassted Bass, Bass Bass Bass Bass Bass Bass Bass, Bassssssss, and of course Beat Dominator.
Technobass has more bass puns than the craft beer industry has hop puns.
There is a subgenre of Technobass called Audio Bass which should have more than just a passing mention. The purpose of Audio Bass is to serve as a stress test for subwoofer sound systems and in particular car audio systems. You go to any music speaker store and ask to test their bassbins, they will likely have a copy of Techmaster PEB on hand to redline the levels and deliver the brown note to every dog in the neighborhood.
A lot of Audio Bass CDs carried their own warning label, as a parody of the Parental Advisory sticker on the Dirty South CDs.
Parental Advisory: Explicit Booooooms.
Audio Bass is barely music; it's more of a force of nature, like an earthquake or a large truck driving by. It tests the limits of subwoofer technology and also the range of human hearing. I like it, but not for too long. It makes my nose itch.
Technobass is also extremely useful if you have a noisy neighbor who keeps playing their music late at night. Simply point your subwoofer at the floor, crank up every frequency lower than 60hz and knock the jesus collectors plates off their motherfucking shelves. You just need to Marty McFly them once. They'll get the hint mighty quickly.
No Technobass music ever charted in any meaningful way, which makes it Underground ApprovedTM. It is still around albeit in a much more reserved state. Early Technobass borrowed heavily from Electro, with its vocoders and Kraftwerk samples. Over the years it evolved with the times, picking up various influences from Detroit Techno, Electrohouse, Dub, Synthwave, Moombahton, and Trap, but that's okay as long as it still has the bass.
If you ever meet anyone eager to show you their love for bass music by whipping out a shitty Brostep or Glitch Hop CD, you have my permisssion to smack that poseur upside the head. And then shatter his windows with the almighty power of Technobass, the most bass there is.
Ish.


## Ghetto Tech
*aka:  Ghetto House, Jit, Footwork* in the Bass scene, emerged in late 90s

This is the top of the Guide. If you're one of those obsessive-compulsive completist types who has to go through everything in a specific order and this is the first genre you're visiting -- like you just have to sort all the bolts in your toolkit before you can start work on the car -- that's probably not how I want you to enjoy this guide. But hey, you do you.
Ghetto Tech is the Detroit version of Miami Bass, with lousy production chops (a deliberate feature). Or what would happen if a DJ mixed Kraftwerk and 2 Live Crew at the same time. He'd probably call it Das Booty.

The idea is to capture the oldskool Detroit Techno sound using crappy analog gear to create a gritty, lo-fi, unpolished, bare-bones, broke-ass groove (hence: ghetto) and cap it off with lyrics -- often just a looping short phrase -- also made to sound lo-fi, grainy, unpolished, broke-ass and mono. And then DJs play it in double time (or at least 1.5x speed) and mix it battle-style, slamming records and cutting every 1.15 minutes or 48 bars.
The music is cheap, disposable, and can be made about as fast as it takes to play it (which is a few minutes tops). It sounds so good because it sounds so bad. Some producers have hundreds of little 2-3 minute songlets in their arsenal, containing only a looping beat and a phrase. This music is made for rapid-fire DJ mixes.
Even the flyers are ghetto.
You might think there is a subtext to this, something about Detroit and inner city decay and poverty and making art through adversity, but nothing going on with Detroit's decline suggests that Ghetto Tech was some sort of final creative gasp from a dying city. The truth is Detroit has always been coming up with new music all the time irrespective of its state of repair. Ghetto Tech may be informed by the conditions around the city, but it does not define them.
I guess what I'm trying to say is: Detroit is like Shaft. It is a complicated city (but you can dig it). You're not going to understand everything in this town in one song, or even one music genre. Or one scene or movement.
Ghetto Tech was initially a localized Detroit thing (every city has a pet sound that doesn't leave city limits -- looking at you Baltimore Club) until DJ Assault (emphasis on the Ass) introduced Dirty South-style raunchy lyrics, earning giggles from every immature Beavis & Butthead-watching partykid out there. The mix that defined the genre was Straight Up Detroit Shit, but the one that blew up was Belle Isle Tech.
And by Belle Isle Tech I mean Ass-n-Titties, the track that became a minor meme on the Internet in the late 90s. I may have had something to do with that.
Assault's mixes established the template for the genre's throwback sound and aggressive DJ mixing, earning the respect of other Technobass producers who up until then were just making it as a goof. Then these producers realized they can go on tour and make lots of money playing this music to ironic white audiences. And that's what makes a genre a genre.
This is one of those genres where despite being a redblooded Detroit child, it feels more at home with its Bass cousins than with its straight and totally serious Techno brothers. You can call it a member of either scene (Bass or Techno, take your pick), it's not going to offend anyone. I have gotten the green light from the Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium over this.
Despite being extraordinarily nichey and a repetitive one-note gimmick that most people get tired of after a couple hours, Ghetto Tech has shown remarkable staying power over the years. Recently it has evolved into a rival to Chicago Hard House/Juke music, coming up with its own brand called Jit. The beef is over who invented the dance "Footwork" that goes with it. Don't ask me why this matters to people.
But Ghetto Tech's heyday was the late 90s and never any other time. I won't say its dead because no genre truly dies, but it's certainly not played outside Detroit anymore. Maybe you can still hear it at DEMF.
Ish.
