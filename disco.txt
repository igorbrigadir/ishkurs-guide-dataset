text=Not just any Disco, but electro boogie! The synthesized direction Disco was heading after its flame was extinguished by American meatheads. Trivia time: the last Disco track to reach #1? Lipps Inc.'s "Funkytown", May 1980. And by then synthesizers and drum machines really started coming into their own, as shown by the track's stark contrast to the big-band, string-section, entire-ensemble disco cuts that permeated radio waves 5 years earlier. Machines allowed making the music easier, faster, and cheaper, but they also brought on a whole bunch of other things. The 80s proved to be the coming-out party for electronic music, as within a year of Disco's infamous backlash everyone, from Reggae (Eddy Grant) to Funk (George Clinton) to Jazz (Herbie Hancock) to movie soundtracks (The Warriors) would employ electronic instruments with glee. As for Disco--it moved to Europe and became Italo Disco.
