text=Psychedelic Trance isn't total horror. In latter years it actually came to be pretty goofy stuff, with the most bizarre samples inserted, like babies crying, people burping and sneezing, and other avant-garde musical interludes. The less sensible, however, ventured into this sonic territory, and I have to tell you: this is, bar none, the most evil, depressing, gut-wrenching, "no hope for mankind's impending war against the machines" music in the world. Like most genres, best--and also best for your acid trip--in small doses. But subject yourself to a whole night of this terror and you'll WANT the madness to leave your head by the morning, and you're damn prepared to end it yourself with your brain firmly smushed into the nearest brick wall. I sincerely think this is a secret government torture weapon that accidently escaped to the public. No one can be this sadistic, can they?
