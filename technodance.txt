text=And then all of a sudden, without word or warning, electronic music was granted mainstream acceptance and exploded all over the pop charts. It was like a revolution, and everyone hitched onto these power pop tracks with silly raps and cooing divas. Fuck, I remember dancing to Snap! in my grade 7 school dance. The public accepted everything, calling it all Techno for some reason. This genre didn't really have a name--then or now. Everyone called everything Techno so it was hard to place the evolution, origin or progression of any kind of set sound or music. So I put it all in here, and call it Techno Dance, even though it's more Dance than Techno, and not really either. It's a shame that most ignorant people still think of this music when they hear the word "techno".
