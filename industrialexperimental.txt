text=Industrial music is already pretty much experimental music to begin with, but wouldn't you know it--they had to go out and be experimental themselves. So this is like Experimental Experimental music. Like....experimental squared or something. It's not quite known whether you can actually hear the added experimentalness in the music that makes it more experimental than other experimental genres--unless you have specialized experimental-attuned ears for it. Because it just sounds like every other experimental genre....just experimental industrial. This sounds really stupid, doesn't it?
