text=The second wave of techno, borrowing influences from pretty much everything. This is the point when the music stopped being made exclusively by black guys in Detroit, and started being made by......white guys in Windsor. So exalted, so true, so mythological, so untouchable. But at the same time, pretty damn uptight and pretentious about what it might think to be deviation from the purity of its sound. Because, well, this IS Detroit Techno we're talking about, after all. Detroit.

If, by chance, you are on the 313 list and you disagree with what I've said here, then make a name for yourself: write your own god damn guide to electronic music and right my wrongs.
