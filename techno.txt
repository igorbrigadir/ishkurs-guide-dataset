text=Techno is the depressing, gritty dystopian genre, a musical personification of the industrial, recession-sacked automotive industries of Detroit in the late 80s.The term was lifted from Alvin Toffler's book "The Third Wave", and by 1990 it had become the music press' fancy word for everything electronic. With that said, it makes sense that the best stuff isn't coming from that city anymore, since the word hardly represents the music--even when used in the proper context. But what it lacks in soul it more than makes up in purity of sound and a mythology so romantic that it can't possibly figure out what to do with itself anymore.
