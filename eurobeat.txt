text=With Jpop and Eurodance as its parents, Eurobeat is truly in a class of its own, with maybe Happy Hardcore as its stupid step-sister. Unlike other genres, Eurobeat knows what its limitations are. It's not trying to save the world or convert everyone over to its spastic, sped-up euro disney cheese. It doesn't foster any illusions about its tweaker formula and erratic sensibilities. And for that you kind of have to respect it. It's role is to be the background music for funny fitness competitions on TV, and it's perfectly happy with that. It's also good wakeup music.
