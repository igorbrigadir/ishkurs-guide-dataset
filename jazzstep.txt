text=Every genre has its token "vocal" subgenre where all the divas like to holler to their hearts content. For Jungle its Jazzstep, with emphasis on the Jazz, and orchestrations, and maybe even a band (as in the case with Roni Size Reprazent). This music is really meant for diners and coffee houses rather than clubs and raves. Lately the music has even been invoking some other elements of diva culture, namely.....dare I say it....Disco Jungle?
