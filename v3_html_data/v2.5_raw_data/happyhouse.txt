text=The official music genre of Dance Dance Revolution, this is by far the most syrupy, saccharine music known to mankind. I bet they play this kind of stuff to calm lunatics at insane asylums locked in padded rooms with pink walls. Bubblegum pop so childish, with lyrics so inane and non-sensical that you can't possibly take it seriously, so it's best that you don't. Just keep nodding politely, and step away carefully, with slow, controlled movements. Or the Japanese schoolgirls might sic their giant robots on you.
