text=Minimalism is music that rewards paying attention. What you think is just the same thing over and over again is actually evolving, but slowly, and you have to keep a tab on what's going on to notice the changes. It's interesting how the first electronic dance tracks that came out had this sort of monotonous repetition in mind. Music so redundant that the only thing that made them dancefloor-worthy was the DJ, there to mix, match, splice, and play them together to create musical collages. Of course, since then electronic music has made great strides to being not so repetitive and hence more pop-sensible, because the masses have never, nor will they ever, digest anything as avant-garde and untrendy as this.
