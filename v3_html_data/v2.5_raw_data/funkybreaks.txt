text=Funky Breaks...that is, REAL Funky Breaks, never gets the respect it deserves. Like Chemical Breaks, it seems to have fallen by the way side back in the last century and now everyone either plays Nu Skool or Florida Breaks, and again that's just a crying shame. Look how many god damn genres there are here, people. For fucks sakes, if you're a breaks DJ, try playing something NEW for once. Or OLD, if it comes to that. DIVERSIFY. How can you morons call yourselves DJs when you neglect most of the music that's out there?!?
