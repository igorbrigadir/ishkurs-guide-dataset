text=Party culture's second generation took the harder, more obscene elements of Rave and amplified them into this: Hardcore Techno. This scene wasn't run by promoters, record labels or even DJs, but by sound crews. And they didn't hold jobs or nominal positions in society; they were techno travelers, part hippies, part post-punk anarchists, part jackboot wearing, skinhead militarists......and all rave. This was the period of the great Soundsystems, and there were several including DIY, Heretik and Bedlam, but the most notoriously famous was Spiral Tribe, bringing their special blend of dirty, filthy, hard-as-fuck techno. The parties were free, mobile, and clandestine. The rules were few, the regulations were none, and the organization was whatever needed to keep the party going. The rave movement became so large and so threatening to daily life that it culminated in the Criminal Justice Bill of 94, and the trial of 13 members of Spiral Tribe for "Conspiracy to Cause a Public Nuisance". Exiled from the country, the free festival scene still lives today, though sadly it seems rave has chosen to go on without it, reforming itself into what it was striking to do away with in the first place: safe and compliant social conformity.
