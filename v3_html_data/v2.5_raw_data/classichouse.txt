text=It's antecedents include funk, soul, blues, jazz, disco, dub, and sometimes even hip hop, but none of that is here because it isn't electronic (unless specified specifically). Still, no genre is an island, and it had to get its inspiration from somewhere. Like, say someone banging a stick on the edge of a wooden box or something. The music's really been around for 40 years (if you don't believe me, go listen to the Jazz Crusaders), the drum machines just make things more groove-centric. Which is a good thing, owing to the highly-convoluted social phenomenon that was about to emerge from this thing.
