text=It's not even a very good or popular track. It certainly didn't make any compilations or "Best of..." lists years later. It was just standard James Brown fair, him doing his thing like only he can. It sounds like a track he probably made in the span of about 5 minutes, while making breakfast one morning ("Makin' some hotcakes....gots ta flip 'em over....gots ta flip 'em over...gots ta flip 'em over....hotcakes! Smokin'! With tha bacon on the siiide! aiiiigh!"). Near the end, however, is a very special moment where he tells the band to shut up and just listen to what the drummer is doing. Something very monumental, he notices. A catchy drum riff that years later would propel hip hop and breakbeat to the heights of the music world, and make James Brown the most sampled man in the history of music. For sample-happy artists like The KLF, there was only one thing to do then: snub the Godfather of Soul and rip off Gary Glitter instead. For the rest of the rap world: you niggas owe the hardest working man in show business your bling bling. All of it.
