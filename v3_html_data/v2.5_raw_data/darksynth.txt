text=Essentially, this entire branch of electronic music really had three distinct origins, all of them not entirely electronic but evolving and criss-crossing each other often: Goth, which was gloomy, morbid romanticism; Industrial, which was abrasive, raw angst, and this--the 'synth' stuff, which was pretty damn apathetic at times, though it would frequently get upset at the other two for being so damn melodramatic. That doesn't mean it didn't have its fun, however. It just thinks the other two whine too much.
