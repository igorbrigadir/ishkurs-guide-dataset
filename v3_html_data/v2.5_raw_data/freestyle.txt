text=A style that's been around at least since the late 80s, this is what you get when you cross Electro with Eurodance. I guess it's called Freestyle because to think that dance music can have a beat other than the 4-to-the-floor bassdrum is revolutionary and liberating. In truth, there is nothing 'free' about this music at all: 90 percent of the tracks use the break ripped off from Afrika Bambaataa's "Planet Rock". Oh, and lots of those string chord stabs too. How free is that? No clue. This, along with Freeform, make up the stupidest genre names ever. There are two great ironies about this music: 1) That despite its branching out into other musical territories, the 4/4 Eurodance is still more interesting and 2) that despite its wanting to stay underground, its trademark sound has become the template for all modern pop music, ripped off by everyone from Madonna to the Spice Girls to N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
