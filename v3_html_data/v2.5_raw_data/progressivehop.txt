text=The real big difference between mainstream rap and underground rap is that, while mainstream rap glorifies deviancy and delinquency, underground rap is apologetic for it. It is also apologetic for the idiotic excesses of mainstream rap. But that's true in any music scene (just watch the way Sasha looks so forlorn and apprehensive whenever someone mentions Oakenfold). Indie vs Corporate Rock, for instance. But just because your music isn't cool doesn't mean it's really good. It just means it isn't cool. Yet in Hip Hop's case, this doesn't apply. Because Progressive Hop, as I call it, really is just way better stuff. Less style, more substance. It's refreshing to hear someone rap multisyllabic words together, and to talk about cartoons or food or ancient mythology or anything other than how cool they think they are.
