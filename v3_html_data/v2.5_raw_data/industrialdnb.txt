text=Industrial and drum n bass go together like a really abrasive music genre meshing with rhythm oriented complex drum patterns. Guys, if you're ever on a night out on the town and you want to impress "the babes", play them some of this. Nothing gets a woman hot n heavy like splitting her ear drum. From this slippery slope, electronic music just gets weirder and weirder.
