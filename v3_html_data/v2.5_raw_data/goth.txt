text=Technically not electronic music, unless you count it's giddy use of sound-enrichment studio techniques to give those wailing choruses that extra level of self-deprication and despair. Goths are not happy people. In fact, next to emo kids they are just about the most self-centred, whiny bunch of neo-narcissists on the face of the earth (if you're wondering what the difference is: classic narcissists go around telling everybody how awesome they are, while neo-narcissists go around telling everybody how awful they are). This doesn't mean you should hate the music. Far from it, it's actually quite snappy and fun. Just don't take it too seriously. The style is fine, but there are more colours in the world than black, y'know.
