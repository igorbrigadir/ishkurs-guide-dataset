text=Everything that doesn't fit into Western Civilization, with a nice tempo. Or artists who go into the deepest African jungles to sample the noises or go live with the lip-stretching tribe of Borneo to learn the clicking languages of the natives and come back and make music from it in an attempt to convince the rest of us that they are "cultured". Yes, ever since the Beatles visited the Maharishi and came back with sitar strings noosed around their necks, musicians have been relentlessly experimentative with finding out what other cultures think about music, and then exploiting it. This isn't a bad thing, it's just an apparent thing. Just don't ever pretend that you are some ethnically tolerant, globally conscious individual because you bought a Pure Moods cd.
