text=G-funk was the undisputed master of all things hip hop for five glorious years in the early 90s. It was invented by Dr. Dre when he left NWA to found Death Row records (with Suge Knight--probably at the point of a gun). It was also killed by Dr. Dre when he announced its demise in 96 (which, not coincidentally, was shortly after Suge Knight went to jail for racketeering. Connection? Naaaaaaah). But the real star of G-funk is Snoop Doggy Dogg, with his laidback, stoned drawl and the way he rhymes without showing too much effort. And that deviously clever pig-latinish language of his, made by saying "izz" after the first letter of every word, or sometimes appending "izzle" at the end of words. It perfectly fit the music, which was fat (and phat), slow, hazy funk, biting Ohio Players Club's funky worm, Zapp's vocoders, and George Clinton's farting bass. It was a reactionary stance by west coast rappers to pretend that the east coast rappers' neo-gangster look didn't phaze them. This sparked the infamous East coast-West Coast rivalry, which peaked in the late 90s with many deaths on either side, including the two high-profile ones of Tupac Shakur of the west and Notorious B.I.G. of the east. So who won? ....I think the South won. They're the ones who still remember that hip hop is about partying, dancing, and having fun, and not about deeeeeeeeez nuuuuuuuts.
