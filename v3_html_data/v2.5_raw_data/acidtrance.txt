text=This, along with Classic Trance (they both pretty much came out about the same time, and are interchangeable, as Classic Trance was mostly acid anyway), best represents what REAL Trance is supposed to feel like. Trippy. Fluent. Hypnotic. Very long and repetitive. Once trance got ahold of the 303, dinner was served. The squiggly rhythm box is tailor-made for sci-fi soundscapes and oscillating patterns, and it's a shame to think that the Acid Trance churned out a decade ago was more thoughtful and interesting than the canned sounds coming out today. Not drug music, but best appreciated by drugs. If Retro trends have anything to say about it, Acid Trance will once again be cool to listen to in about.....7 years. One can only hope.
