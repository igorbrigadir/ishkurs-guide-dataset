text=What a meaningless name for a music genre. Fucking FREEFORM?!?!? What the hell does that mean? That could be anything, from chaotic dissonance to a Beatles jam session. But it mostly chooses to be re-constituted Happy Hardcore and Trancecore, mixed in with lots of acid. But in a "free" form of way, or something. It's basically just the next level for the never-say-die world of childish ritalin happy beats. Freeform is a lot like Happy Hardcore, but without all the cheese. Or like really fast Progressive Trance, but without all the annoying anthems. Or like NRG, but without all the stupid.
