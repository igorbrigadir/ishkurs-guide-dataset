text=Motherfucking electro! Kraftwerk invented it in 1971. Hip hop hijacked it in 1981. Everyone forgot it by 1991. And then everyone started releasing "Hey! Remember Kraftwerk?" albums in 2001. Goes to show how much things run full circle. All electronic music everywhere pretty much owe its existance to Kraftwerk. Right next to James Brown and The Beatles, they are the most influential musicians of all time. It also doesn't hurt that robots are so totally wicked fucking awesome.
