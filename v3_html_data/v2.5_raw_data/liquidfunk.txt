text=In the early going of the 21st century, the one form of music that's been the most creative and experimentative has been Jungle. So many genres now are exploding all over the place that it's going to take a couple years for the past to settle things down and the Official Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium to make heads or tails of things. From what can be gathered, Jungle just seems to be taking every single other style and applying it to its own eclectic output. Thus, you have Electrostep (Electro and Jungle), Trancestep (Trance and Jungle), Techstep (Techno and Jungle), Neurofunk (Acid and Jungle) and now......at long last...this! Liquid Funk (House and Jungle). Why Liquid Funk? Don't ask me, I don't come up with these names. Well, sometimes.
