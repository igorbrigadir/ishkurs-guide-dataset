text=Techno and industrial actually go pretty well together, since they both worship mechanicalism and abrasive technology so much. When most people think of "industrial techno", however, they probably think of the commercial stuff that makes teenagers shoot their classmates. Well....no. That's not industrial techno. This is. Pay attention, stupid media people.
