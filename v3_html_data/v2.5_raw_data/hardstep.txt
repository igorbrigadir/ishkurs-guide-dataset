text=Don't confuse Hardstep with Darkstep, though you might as well call it Darkerstep. This is the mid-90s precursor to Techstep, when the familiar two-step drum pattern (boom cha, boom-cha) started infiltrating all areas of the genre, which coincided with the replacing of the word 'jungle' with 'drum n bass' in scenester circles and self-important music magazines. Have I said the word 'step' enough?
