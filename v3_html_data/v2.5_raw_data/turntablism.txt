text=ATTENTION ALL DJS: IF YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THIS, YOU ARE NOT A "MUSICIAN". In the world of playing recorded music, one genre stands far and away from the rest as the one true art of competence, skill, and showmanship: Turntablism. The idea that a record can be scratched, back-spinned, cutted, sliced, spliced, and manipulated as a deliberate musical feature warrants so much praise and respect I crap my pants just thinking about it. It doesn't even seem right to call them DJs. It's unfair that these people are given the same title as some idiot blathering away on morning radio, or a tacky human stereo playing cds at a wedding. That's just impolite and rude. Call them what they really are: Record Gods.
