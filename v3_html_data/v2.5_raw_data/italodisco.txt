text=There was a big backlash to everything Disco in America in 1980. In Europe, this didn't happen, so Disco naturally progressed over there to what it had been hinting at for several years: a stripped down, mechanical version of itself dubbed Italo Disco for reasons unknown as very few of the artists were actual Italians. But they all sang in english, which is odd because english was universally a second language to them, as evidenced by the fact that the lyrics make no sense and the vocalists have thick accents of indeterminate origin. Still, despite these shortcomings, the music kicks ass, and is recognized as the world's first completely electronic commercial dance music, predating House, Techno, Electro, and just about everything else. The music is seriously stupid good fun once you get past its dated, tinny sound. I now have ten times more of this music than any other genre. And I might very well start spinning it too. No, I'm serious. You don't believe me, do you?
