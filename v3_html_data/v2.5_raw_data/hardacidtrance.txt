text=Hard. Acid. Trance. It's kind of actually like Goa, only without all the hippy shit. That makes it better by default. Pretty interchangeable with Hard Acid Techno, though the major difference seems to be where this genre seeks to fill dancefloors, the techno variant will scheme ways to FLATTEN dancefloors. Either way, they are the twin masters at making the little 303 box squeel with glee. Like Progressive Trance's patenting of the breakdown-build-anthem formula, Hard Acid Trance can also lay claim to a similar-styled gimmick for quick, cheap, instant acclaim: the "drop the music for one or two bars, and then bring it all back motherfucker" technique. And like Progressive Trance, the formula was used credibly here, but then overused to the point of ad nausium by its offspring--namely, NRG.
