text=Ah yes, the official genre named by Tim 'The Toolman' Taylor. He even provided pads and leads for a few of the tracks too, using his trusty Binford cordless screw saw drill wrenching spork. He asked Al to track some vocals, and he replied with "I don't think so, Tim". Seriously though, this is where noize gets its inspiration: the avant-garde industrial experimentalism of the 80s. Since then, no new ground has really been covered, so instead of going for originality, producers have elected to go for volume. There's actually several subtle styles within this infinitesimally small community (Power Noise being one of them), but....let's be honest, here: it isn't necessary to put those genres up, is it? It's not like you're springing at the chance to listen to them. Just take comfort in the fact that they're there, and people actually like the stuff.
