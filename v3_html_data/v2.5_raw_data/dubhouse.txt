text=This kind of stuff's been around at least for 30 years. Take reggae, remove the lyrics and harmonies. What you have left is what those lovable Jamaicans like to call the dub. Yeah: Dub. Sheesh, sounds like one of those pet words stoners always come up with in their spare time. Add a beat to it and it becomes Dub House. It was the first ever tool for DJs--a groove to lay down under all the anthems and floorfillers--somehow making it a genre in its own right. Now it's influenced everything else as well. There's probably a million and one sub genres of this--ambient dub, techno dub, dub dub--but I'm too lazy to find out what they got going for them. But god bless those wacky Jamaicans and their wonderful detail to rhythm.
