text=House, trance and techno start here. The 909 is the yin to the 808's yang. Where the 808 is tinny, mechanical, raspy and twitchy, the 909 is heavier (physically and sonically), deeper and fuller. The standard setup is to employ the 909 for the groove, and the 808 for the percussion. The 909 doesn't have a bassdrum--that's just a weird thud emanating from the box that has launched a million dance records. Stick a guitar distortion pedal on it and you have hardcore. Add some decks and effects and you have Richie Hawtin. If there's one great signature sound about this beast, it's definitely the handclaps. The 808 may have the cowbell. But The 909 is ALL about the handclaps.
