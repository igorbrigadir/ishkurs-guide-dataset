text=Pretty interchangeable with Eurodance and Epic Trance, except for one idiot feature: the abject rape and decimation of fine 80s tunes and classic ballads by making trite, derivative "dance" mixes of them. Stupid. Just stupid stupid stupid. Listening to these tunes makes you yearn for the originals way more than you'd ever want to dance in a club to them. From "Total Eclipse of the Heart" to "Keep Me Hanging On" to a cutesy version of the Hamsterdance song (yes, I said HAMSTERDANCE, fuck dammit. Go P2P for it yourself, and brace yourself for the horror of horrors). If there is any redeeming feature of Epic House that exists, I haven't seen it yet. This genre is absolutely shameless and without remorse. It is a gimmicky vehicle for cheap radio one hit wonders through upgraded nostalgia, and is completely devoid of originality, substance and value whatsoever. Whoever makes this shit should be shot.
