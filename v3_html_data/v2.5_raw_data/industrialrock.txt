text=Ah yes, Industrial Rock. The form of Industrial that has had the most commercial success, and it's all Trent Reznor's fault. Just like how it's all Morrissey's fault there's emo. Heavy metal (and metalheads) needed somewhere to go after grunge nearly crushed it out of existence, so they latched onto this like it was, well, the Next Big Thing. It doesn't differentiate from Coldwave much, except that the songs are more pop accessible. I guess you could call it Epic Industrial then. Ha ha ha. The music's actually not all that bad. The artists have all been featured on Mortal Kombat compilations at one time or another, and they have a tendancy to brainwash troubled teenagers into shooting their classmates every now and then, but other than that it sounds alright to me.
