text=Wouldn't it be great if this genre existed? It would be the one redeeming feature of trance, the genre to actually inject something new into it, and make Trance interesting again for the first time since 1995. I've kept my eyes peeled, and there's not much to make out yet. But there is that interesting 'trancestep' stuff as of late, that kind of ventures near the territory, but nothing yet that is full-on, booty shakin', cracker raps. How hard is it to get 2 Live Crew and BT together?
