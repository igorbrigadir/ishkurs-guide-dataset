text=God, this stuff is so fucking boring. Retaining the idiotic basslines of Speed Garage, the hiccupping stacato beats of that derivative Nu Soul schlock that dares call itself RnB, and even worse: the endless crooning by 'guest' popstars (hence all the 'featuring' accolades in playlists), divas, and whiny narcissists who like to think of themselves as just too damn cool to be listened to by you. They're all style-biting Mariah Carey, so it's pretty much her fault. The only good thing about 2-step is, unlike Speed Garage, it won't be used by invading alien armadas to their high councils as grounds for turning the Earth into a giant ashtray.
