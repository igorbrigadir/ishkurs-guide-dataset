text=Metalcore is, like Symphonic Trance, one of those obscure genres, in that no label or artist (that I know of) deals in it exclusively, but every once in awhile something will come out. I'm still trying to decide whether it's just heavy metal bands using thundering drum machines (gotta love that distorted 909 bass beat), or gabber producers using guitar samples ala Buttrock Goa. Hardcore and Heavy Metal are kin, after all, in much the same way that cheese and butter are kin.
