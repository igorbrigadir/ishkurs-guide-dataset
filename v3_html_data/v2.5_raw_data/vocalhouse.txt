text=This can pretty much be any of the other genres, really. What makes it Vocal is, well...vocals. Not just any vocals but loud, dominating, high-class crooning ones by diva songstresses. That makes this genre pretty hit and miss, depending on whether the diva is any good or not, or whether she annoys the hell out of you (which can happen with alarming frequency, believe me). For what it's worth, I tend to think that house classics have the best Divas, as the modern stuff has way too much of that insipid octave modulating RnB crap like a bunch of Destiny's Child rejects. Can you just hold a single note for longer than a fucking second, you stupid tarts?!?!?
