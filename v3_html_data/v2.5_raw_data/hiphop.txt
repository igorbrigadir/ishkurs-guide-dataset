Ha ha ha. Fooled you there for a second, didn't I? No, truthfully, this is probably the most important form of music in the latter half of the 20th century. What began as simple MCing over bare-bones rhythms has become a full-fledged industry devoted to providing clothing and entertainment to an affluent, middle class teenage suburban social tribe known as "wiggers". With that said, oldskool or classic hip hop was mostly about partying, singing and dancing. It was fairly silly, benign music--and extremely accessible and tolerant. But in all honesty, if you didn't know what this is, then you really have no business using this guide to learn about music. Try MTV instead.
