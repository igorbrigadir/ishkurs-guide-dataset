text=Not really an upgrade of 80s Italo Disco, but its made in the same place, so I guess the name is appropriate. Slower, thicker beat than Eurodance, but its signifying and most addictive feature is the VOCODERS!! Love those lovely, oscillating vocoders! You can never have enough vocoders. Hell, the whole reason why most of the songs don't have any actual lyrics but just nonsense human melodies (la da bee dee doo da lee da) is because they sound so cool with vocoders. Rediscovered by Daft Punk legend Thomas Bangalter (the purveyor of everything 80s), used lavishly by everyone in his wake. This genre has had one monster hit: Eiffel 65's "Blue", but just because it's way overplayed doesn't mean you should discount the entire genre. There's some wicked-ass stuff here.
