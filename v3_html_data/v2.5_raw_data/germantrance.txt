text=DIES IST TECHNO SEX!! OONCE OONCE OONCE OONCE OONCE OONCE OONCE OONCE! This is the goofiest, poppiest trance music that exists, but like its very eurocentric sister Eurodance (which emerged around the same time), it's not all that bad. Primarily for two reasons: 1) Acid and 2) It doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, and if it does bombard you with pompous anthems, they're merely to speed things along. That is, not dwelling on heavy, uplifting, emotional shmaltz. But especially the acid. From this genre came two offspring: one took just the acid and became Hard Acid Trance. The other took just the bouncey basslines and became NRG. There's nothing wrong with straight-ahead, dancey pop beats. Music is never meant to change your life or give you a new car; it's escapism pure and simple. Sometimes I wish trance would understand how stupid it's making itself look by even trying to be something else.
