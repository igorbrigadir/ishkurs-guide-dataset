text=Another one of those confusedly named genres as it is neither Acid nor Jazz. Well, sort of. Sandwiched between Deep House and Trip Hop, this is the Downtempo genre with soul. And groove. And rhythm. And funk. And Jazz. This kind of music is best meant for late-night coffee houses and alternative culture eateries where the waitresses are all short-haired lesbians, the coffee comes in tall glasses, and there's a small smokey stage where a crowd of intellectuals wearing dark-brimmed glasses are listening to some guy in a turtle neck reciting crappy poetry like a bunch of pretentious post-ginsbergian beatnicks. Ooh yeah! Gotsta love that post-modern poetry.
