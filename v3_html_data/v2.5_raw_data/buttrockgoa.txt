text=There's enough sub-subgenres of psychedelic-goa-israeli-mediterranean-middle eastern trance (ie: anything not euro, which inherently makes it far more interesting) to warrant its own trance section altogether, and in compliance with the true ethos of trance it should very well get one. And maybe someday it will. But for now, I'll just list my favourites and/or most prominant ones. Psychedelic trance envelopes all of that. And Buttrock Goa is easily the best one. Heavy metal and trance go so well together.
