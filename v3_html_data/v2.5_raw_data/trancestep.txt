text=This is just waaaay too much fun to be ignored!! It makes you dance and laugh. Finally, a jungle genre that's not trying to be hardcore and edgier than thou. Silly, happy party music. What's wrong with that? Enough attitude, let's get down and boogie. Life isn't all machine guns and urban warfare, you tarts. Take your damn hoodies off and stay awhile. Trancestep is going to show you the way, since all things Synthron-Electroclash-robotglamsynthcorepop were blowing up in the new millenium, some keen dnb artists decided to ride the wave, only inserting the two-step drum pattern where applicable. The result is this: Trancestep. Jungle's final redemption! Well, okay, so only John B is doing it. The rest sound too much like Neurofunk, but keep in mind this genre is relatively new, so just wait for more tracks to come out. Hopefully.
