text=Ambient and Techno actually go pretty well together. It's a common feature in this scene to see polar opposites attract one another like a magnet. So Techno producers actually put out subdued, minimal, soft melodic compositions all the time, often under not-so-secretive pseudonyms. Also: these tracks make excellent intro pieces for techno sets, as a kind of "calm before the storm" setting before the all-out polyrhythmic assault begins. Cool, eh?
