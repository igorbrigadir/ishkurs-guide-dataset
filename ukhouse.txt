text=It's almost as if England (and maybe Europe as well) had been collectively stuffing its face full of sweet, syrupy, cavity-inflicting cookie cutter McTrance for 3 years (96-99), and then suddenly got sick to its stomach and threw it all up. Or maybe it was just Britain's major DJs who got sick of the anthem schlock, and vowed never to spin it ever again. And appropriately, where they commanded, the people, like polite little sheep, obeyed. Then Sasha and Digweed and their ilk wanted to be taken seriously so they started moving into...this sound. Whatever you want to call it, it doesn't matter; it serves its purpose, which is to be anti-anthem. And then as if to REALLY show everyone how above-it-all they were, they gave it a really pretentious name out of an adjective: Progressive. Progressive what? Fuck if I know, after 3 years trance snobs are still arguing over that part. Since it means absolutely nothing, then, I'm calling it Brit House, because if anyone could make house (trance?) music this boring and monotonous, it's the British.
