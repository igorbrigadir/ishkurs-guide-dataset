text=Kind of a hodgepodge of stuff, really, because at the time standards hadn't settled in yet (read as: musicians weren't boring and unoriginal hacks ripping off each other's concepts). This is the post-acid house era music (by 1989 the word "acid house party" was already old and busted; the new hotness was the word "Rave"). But before the mental mantasm of hoover-driven rave tunes had shown up, there was this. Not quite house. Not quite techno. Not quite ambient. What was it? Not sure. Call it techno. Everything was being called techno anyway. Only with a slightly "euro" feel to it. Hence: eurotechno.
