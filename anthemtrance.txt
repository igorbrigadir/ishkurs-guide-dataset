text=Progressive Trance actually had a pretty good idea. There's nothing wrong with some tension and release in your song. That's what people listen to music for. To bring the music down to a crawl before exploding out with a crescending climax is one of the best tricks in music. And besides, if the DJ's too stupid and inept to figure out how to provide adequate tension and release during his sets through careful track selection and record management, why not do it for him, essentially removing any skill he thought he might've needed to have in order to be a good DJ. Breakdowns, builds, and memorable melodies are not a new thing in trance. But what Anthem Trance did was completely and totally abuse and pervert them. Where Progressive Trance used them to somewhate accentuate the moment (like say a lull before the main synth kicks back in), Anthem Trance used them for the track's entire purpose. This cookie cutter, by-the-numbers formula dominated the english club scene and trance, once the quirky kind of music with only a niche market, reformed itself into a neverending series of pop jingles and by doing so supplaunted house as the most popular dance music in the world.
