text=Yeah, like who couldn't see this one coming? Two-step at its finest, with the ole "buzzing beehive" background noise. Junglists like this one a lot. Even the poser ones in their lil hoodies wearing those 3/4 length flood pants like a bunch of fucking twats. Yeah, you know who I'm talking about. The kind of kids who, if Ecko made its own ice cream they would start eating it just to say it's better than all other ice cream. Yeah. They all like this a lot, though not as much as Jump Up.
