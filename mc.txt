text=The Master of Ceremonies first got his start as a conductor of sorts, introducing the musical talent and becoming the host of the party. The practice started off fairly benign in--where else--Jamaica, where the MC would add his voice as a freestyle adlib singer, becoming part of the music. Then it was exported to New York where it became Hip Hop, and as time went on Hip Hop MCs decided that they were more important than the music, and then later on declared that they were more important than everything. Jungle and Breaks MCs tried to do the same, with limited amounts of success and bravado. But the important part to remember is that an MC is not supposed to transcend the music or even compete with it. That's when everything goes to shit. The original Jamaicans didn't do that. They understood that the object was to liven the party atmosphere, not to become the centre of attention. They were simply Toastmasters, which is something that modern MCs rarely do anymore. Toasting. I like that word. Who toasts anymore? It seems like every freestyler today is trying too hard to be some sharp-tongues, insult-armed "lyrical assassin" rather than someone who actually wants to improve the quality of the party.
