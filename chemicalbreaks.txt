text=The West Coast sound. Techy breaks, digital, skippitty-skip-skip breaks, hence the synthetic and 'chemical' feel. This stuff used to be hot shit, back when John Kelley's "Funkydesertbreaks" and Funky Techno Tribe Full Moon rave parties were all the scene needed. Pretty interchangeable with acid, but not always needing a 303. I don't think anyone does it too much anymore, which really sucks ass, because this stuff is infinitely more cool than the dilapidated "nu" stuff. As always, the oldskool is skooling the nuskool. What else is new?
