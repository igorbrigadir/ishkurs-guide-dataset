text=Video Game Music. Since our entire generation grew up playing Super Mario Bros. and Tetris for hours on end, we have the tacky, 8-bit, synthesized melodies of Hip Tanaka literally grafted into our consciousness. Remixes and reworkings galore, and also the sampling and utilization of oldskool game consoles to make itself a fully realized genre of techno. The Chiptune scene, as it likes to call itself, has been around for as long as computer and video consoles have had built in music sounds, taking them apart and using them as musical instruments. Pretty inventive stuff, but only for the truly geeky gearhead. For the rest of us, it'll always be gimmick music, though I don't mind it at all. I'd go nuts if someone played the Metroid theme song at a party.
