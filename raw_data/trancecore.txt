text=Trancecore and Freeform artists, labels, compilations and music do a lot of bleeding, so don't feel ashamed if you can't tell the difference between the two. Basically, if its hard and driving and trying to fuck you up, it's probably Freeform...and if it's uplifting and epic, then it's a Trancecore track you're listening to. Be on the lookout for recycled anthems from Anthem and Epic Trance (as well as that nauseating "NOT Trance" shite). It's actually pretty tolerable, probably because there's no room nor time for 3-minute long breakdowns in Hardcore.
