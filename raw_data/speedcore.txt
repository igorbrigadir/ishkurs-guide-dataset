text=This isn't music, this is just a gigantic dick-wagging, more-hardcore-than-thou staring contest between Hardcore producers to see which of them can be assaulted with "BPM = 1000" on their drum machines and not flinch. I can't possibly think of any drug that would make you want to dance this fast. Or even headbang to it. I get a headache after two minutes of doing that anyway. I guess that's why 90 percent of the tracks are 30 seconds long. It's the music equivalent of holding your breath; that is, if done for long enough, you will pass out.
