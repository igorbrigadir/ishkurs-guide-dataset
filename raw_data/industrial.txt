text=Genesis P'Orridge must be the most quotable man in modern music. Seriously, everything that guy says turns into a de facto music industry declaratitive term for all time. He got his start in the 70s forming the band Throbbing Gristle (what a great name!), releasing music on his own label, called 'Industrial Records'. That word--and the label--would go on to become synonymous with all abrasive forms of music for the rest of the century and beyond. Then, later on in the 80s, he forms his Psychic TV project and begins toying with the TB-303, christening the new sound "acid house". The name stuck. Then, in 1992, he's asked about the kind of music coming from artists like Leftfield. His response: Progressive House. Man, is there anything that guy doesn't say that isn't so catchy and applicable? If I were a marketer, I would follow him around every day and bottle whatever he says and sell it.
