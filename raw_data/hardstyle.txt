text=As what usually happens in the creation of new genres, you take one specific thing that makes another genre cool, and revolve your new genre entirely around it. So this is what happens when artists go "hey, that thunderous beat and bassline and squelching synthline sounds really cool". Whamo, there you go: new genre (or nu, I should say). Eventually, Nu Style Gabber producers started noticing it, so they dived right in, thinking "hey, no problem. We can make this shit too." What's the difference between them? About 30 bpm. Play your Nu Style Gabber records at -8, and Hardstyle is born. But it's still not hard enough to be included among the Hardcore genres. Though maybe that Hard Dance subgroup.
