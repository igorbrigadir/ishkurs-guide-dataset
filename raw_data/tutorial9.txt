text=Actually, electronic music's origin was really in 1761! Because it was in 1761 (or somewhere thereabouts) that Jean-Baptiste de Laborde invented the Clavecin Electrique, or "Electric Harpsichord". It was more like a kind of a clavichord, only the clappers were charged with static electricity to ring the bells. Don't ask me how this works, it's got something to do with baroque mysticism I think.
Also, in 1761, Johann Maelzel came upon the brilliant idea of creating the Panharmonicon, which was the first mechanical keyboard that, although technically not electronic (it ran on diesel fuel) automated the playing of all the other instruments in the orchestra. Maelzel then went on to design a universal spec for the Panharmonium by which every musical instrument everywhere could adhere to, so they could be hooked up to one another for universal control and compatibility. Where trumpets could play drums and violins could play clarinets and that sort of stuff. He called it Medieval MIDI, and it was a revolutionary concept for the time, but despite its endorsement by larger-than-life composers like Beethoven, it wasn't received too well so Maelzel would have to wait another 200 years before his dream of hooking every instrument up into the Voltron symphony would be realized.
Also, in 1761, Benjamin Franklin invented the glass harmonica, which has nothing to do with electronic music, but it's a pretty useful fact to know in case you're ever on Jeopardy someday. 
And Mozart composed his first symphony in 1761. Of course, he was five years old at the time and his song probably sucked ass (I mean...come on. I wrote my first novel when I was eight. Not that it was any good), and besides, he had help from the evil Earl of Darkwood, kidnapping music prodigies from the 5 5ecret 5tar 5ystems in his quest for immortality.
So yeah. 1761. The year it all began. I know I've said this before, but I mean it this time.
