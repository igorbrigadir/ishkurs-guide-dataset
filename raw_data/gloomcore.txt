text=Is it called Gloomcore? I've heard it is. It's really simple music, basically like minimal techno--that feels gloomy--and then someone will do a spoken word or monologue or something that sounds really dreary and/or sinister, that usually has something to do with drugs or etards. I guess the only real consistent artists in this field are Green Velvet and The Horrorist, but every once in awhile another one will come out with something. I think. Who knows. Who cares. Ain't this music guide fun? Camera's ready, prepare to flash!
