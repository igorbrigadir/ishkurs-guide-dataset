text=If you're wondering what the difference is between Tribal House, Trance and Techno, no one really cares. Tribal is Tribal, for that is how any sane record store or music pool will catalogue things. But here's a handy maxim to carry along to make sense of the redundant: Tribal House has a groove, Tribal Trance has a synth (and, more often than not, wailing middle eastern/hindu chant), Tribal Techno has a percussion. Though not always. Tribal rarely gets the respect it deserves.
