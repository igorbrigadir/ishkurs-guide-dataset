text=The reason why it's called Handbag in parts not American is because girly flocks wearing tight capri pants and tube tops or something would colesce in clubs to dance to this music around piles of their purses and handbags on the dance floor. I've never actually seen that happen, but it's certainly believable. Eurodance is the undisputed king of creative cheese: that is, cheesy dance music that is far from annoying. It's dedication to silly, spastic fun, with buff dancers running around and funny raps about dancing, love, and the love of dancing has made an artform out of the lighter side of music. Where other genres in the same vein failed due to their pompous delivery and overblown self-important schmaltz, Eurodance got it right: pop music as it is, was, and should be. Nothing more.
