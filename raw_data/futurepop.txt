text=You know how when you meet someone from another geographical region, they have a funny accent? But to them, you're the one who has the funny accent. Well, in the great mess that is the music of Trance, Futurepop has the same kind of polar opposite perceptions based on one's musical background. To the Industrial/Goth community, Futurepop is cheesy, silly commercial pop music, a blend of the straight-ahead driving synths and treated vocals of EBM with the flying strings of euphoric Epic Trance. But to the Epic Trance scene, Futurepop seems at once impersonal and harsh, a product of the dark, brooding Industrial scene that is disdainful to their sensitive, trance attuned ears. Since that's the case, then Futurepop may very well be the greatest Trance genre ever. Even better than goa.
