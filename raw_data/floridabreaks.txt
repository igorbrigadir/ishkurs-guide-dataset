text=Florida Breaks is like Funky Breaks but without the funk. Yet it has more bass (though not as much bass as Miami Bass' bass). And then added are samples, sirens and whistles (ugh, whistles....*shudder*) and also overblown egos. Ballcaps and hoodies everywhere. Every major genre has at least one big 'jibtek' genre that is immensely popular only among skinny, pale teenagers hiked up on amphetamines. In House, it's Stupid House (obviously). In Trance, it's NRG. For Breaks, its this here. The Florida sound. If you honestly remove all the newbie ravers and their friends offering them drugs, this genre does not exist, and Icey is flipping burgers instead. That's it.
