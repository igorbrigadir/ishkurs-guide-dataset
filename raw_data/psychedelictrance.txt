text=The difference between Psychedelic and Goa Trance is really negligible, and if you ask anyone involved they'll readily say that there is no difference, much the same way that junglists will say there is no difference between Jungle and Drum n Bass (even though there is). To put it succinctly, Psychedelic Trance removes the hindu/middle-eastern influences and melodies and full-on blasts you with mindfuck music...teleport zappers, star trek tweeps, nintendo twerps, theremin squeels, feedback hums and radio antennae frequency squelches. Well...Goa might have all that stuff too. Hmmmm. Let's say this instead: Goa is more organic, and Psy is more cybernetic. But they're both futuristic sci-fi music. Okay, fine: they are the same damn thing. But there's just so much good music here to only squeeze in one genre. And if you think I'm done here, wait until you check out Psytekk. It's like HR Giger on acid.
