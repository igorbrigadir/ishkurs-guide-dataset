text=The Winstons were just a soul/RnB group with one hit record: a single in 1969 called "Color Me Father". So what, you think. A one-hit wonder because you wonder how they got the one hit. Yet it was the B-side of that single that contained something strangely extraordinary: an instrumental called "Amen Brother" that was all about its spastic drum solo. And when I say 'spastic drum solo' I mean wave your arms in the air like Grover, make some noise, and get ready fo' da rewind, Boh! My Selectah! Yup. That's it right there; the infamous Amen Break, staple sample of every breakbeat and jungle producer's arsenal. Without this, junglists would not exist. *gasp* God forbid!
