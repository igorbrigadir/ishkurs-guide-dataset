text=You'd think they'd be really good at it, what with Kraftwerk starting the whole unfeeling, mechanicalistic techno paradigm in the first place. But in truth German Techno sounds a lot like Tech Trance. Or Techno Trance. Trancey techno, if you will. If it's the full-on, hardened percussive stuff you're looking for, you're better off skipping this and just heading over to the Swedish guys, who do it a lot better. There is a really abrasive, swedish-techno-sounding sub-subgenre, however, that has emerged called "Schranz" (whatever the hell that means). It is particularly good. You can tell which ones are which. Or maybe you can't.
