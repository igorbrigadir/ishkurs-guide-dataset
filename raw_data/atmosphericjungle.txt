text=LTJ Bukem is like the Michael Jordan of this genre. It's pretty interchangeable with Trip-hop too, as most of the artists release tracks in either (and then remixes of those tracks in both). Thanks to television advertisments, this music now evokes images of driving out in the countryside or along the autobahn in your new sports car. Or BMW. It's about as 'easy-listening' as jungle is willing to get, without being sneered at by all the "hardcore" junglists. Yeah, as if the music you enjoy is part of some grand, worldwide competition or something. Sheesh.
