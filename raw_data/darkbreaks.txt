text=They're actually not all that dark, but they're moody, gritty, and not all that clean and smooth. Pretty much a segment genre of Nuskool Breaks that take its hard driving basslines to logical extremes. Most subgenres seem to be bred that way: they take the single most popular element of another genre, and then revel in it. To an almost cartoonish extent (for perfect examples of this, listen to Rave and Oldskool Rave Hardcore...and Epic Trance). This would be like figuring out that the most pleasing part of your morning cereal is the sugar you put in it, so why not skip the bran flakes and have nothing but milk and sugar for now on. Less is more. Except in this case, because Dark Breaks is actually pretty good.
