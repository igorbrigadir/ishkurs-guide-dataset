text=Fast (sometimes), but not as fast as Speedcore. All evilness comes here. Hell awaits. The Official sponsor of Pagan rituals and occult ceremonies.

I bet this would be great music for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs too. Or maybe a romantic evening by a roaring fire. A fire...FROM HELL! Hahahahaha......mmmmmm...nice, young, nubile virgins.
