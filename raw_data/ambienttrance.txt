text=Ambient Trance sounds a lot like Minimal Trance, if a Minimal Trance genre existed. Or like Ibiza Trance, only not so...organic. It could also be Ambient Techno or Ambient House, but with this many hair-splitting Ambient genres, who the hell's counting? Would that trance DJs pay attention to this stuff more often, their sets might actually be interesting for once. And that's saying something for a form of music more likely to put you to sleep then make you want to dance all night.
