text=This genre is to House music like Superman is to the Superfriends: indispensable. Everything that other House genres can do, Deep House does. Sometimes better. In fact, this genre IS House music. It encapsulates everything House music is supposed to do, supposed to sound like, supposed to make you feel, to a T. If there was no Deep House, House just wouldn't be House. Deep House is the sound that holds the whole genre together. There are several sub-sub-genres of this, all of it good, including Mark Farina's own special brand of Mushroom Jazz. One of my favourites is a really swanky, soulful sub-sub-genre tentatively named (meaning, called only by my friends and I) "Dad House", because it always evokes images of your father walking around the house in his bathrobe on a Sunday morning, reading the paper and smoking on a pipe. Well, mine anyway.
