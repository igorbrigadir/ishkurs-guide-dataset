text=Like rats scrambling from a sinking ship, Progressive Trance and Anthem Trance producers escaped the banality of the builds, breakdowns and chorus melodies when it was declared by the genre's elite (read: Sasha and Digweed) as being thoroughly uncool to keep playing the stuff. So they latched onto the other genres as a way to stay ahead of the pack. Break Trance (Breakbeat), Tech Trance (Techno) and Deep Trance (House) are such genres created in the wake of the Great Anthem crash.
