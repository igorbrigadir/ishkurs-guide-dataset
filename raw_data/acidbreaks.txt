text=Acid Breaks! This and Chemical Breaks (and Big Beat, I guess) are the most favourite genres of action movie trailers, sports hilight reels, corporate powerpoint presentations and spastic TV ads featuring people doing something extreme like driving really fast while bird watching. I can't listen to this anymore without getting silly images in my head of jumping in the air, pausing while the camera pans around me, and then resume kicking some guy in the head. This is part of the "electronica" wave of mainstream acceptance in the late 90s.
