text=Pretty interchangeable with Nu-NRG, except where Nu-NRG is hard and driving every once in awhile, Stupid House (better known as UK Hard House for reasons unknown as it sounds neither hard nor housey) is just retarded. It's probably the offbeat bass stabs that lend credence to its defining 'stupid' sound. And the horn fanfares, making it sound like silly circus music. And the crowd cheering samples, which make it seem cheap and gimmicky. But where other party music (Happy Hardcore, Eurodance) has a self-aware, tongue-in-cheek affability, Stupid House here legitimately tries to pass itself off as something serious and genuine. Like actual contentious music. A chip-on-its-shoulder, more-hardcore-than-thou ethos, something so laughably ridiculous even Gabber House looks cooler in comparison. Pretending to be what it's not makes this whole genre fraudulent and insulting to those who just want to have a good time. And that's before you see how the kids dance to it. Stupid House is the bargain bin of electronic music. It also encompasses those signature-melody tracks that are always packaged in 'BEST CLUB ANTHEMS EVER' compilations, like The Launch, which are the musical equivalent of junk food.
