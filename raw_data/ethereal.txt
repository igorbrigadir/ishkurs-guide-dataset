text=Ethereal is like Ambient for goths, and technically not electronic music (half the time), but it's important in the development of New Age, Dark Ambient, Darkwave, and other related styles. Ethereal music is a lot of whining and chanting and pagan/wiccan/celtic type stuff, which totally rules if all the mother earth priestesses look like Shannon Doherty and Fairuza Balk. It is also incredibly operatic, melodramatic, dark and morbid....even for goths.
