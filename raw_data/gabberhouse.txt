text=Holy shit is this ever cheesy. What is this even doing in Hardcore? It sounds like a house genre that kinda wandered off and now has gotten itself lost, with Rave hoovers and mental fuckup cheesiness. This is the cheesiest cheese that you will ever cheese on. Even the cheese of the cheese who make this cheese are cheesy. The cheesiest of cheesy cheeses abound. It's cheesy even for euro cheese. Most wouldn't even cheese this cheese. Absolute cheese cheese.
