text=Of all the tribal genres, this is probably the one closest to New Age/World Beat music, but it's breaks in that a lot of Nu Skool/Progressive Breaks producers will dabble in it from time to time. But it's not really a genre that anyone produces or spins exclusively, unless they're a hippy sitting in the back with a bongo drum. And that's just annoying.
