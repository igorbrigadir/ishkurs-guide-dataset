text=I suppose The KLF are to be responsible for this, when they released their 'Stadium House' trilogy in 89. But more or less Anthem House is really just the less-used, broke-ass cousin of Anthem Trance, evoking images of 'hands in the air' cheering about positively nothing in giant soccer stadiums and british superclubs with thousands of other people who would normally be annoying the hell out of you if you weren't on such great drugs. Gang vocals, cheering noises, and catchy melodies. This is the kind of music that's like really rich chocolate: tasty in small doses; will make you sick to your stomach if you're inundated with too much of it. Trance crackers, take note.
