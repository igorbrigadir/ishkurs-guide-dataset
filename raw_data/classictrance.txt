text=Not a genre (that I know of) yet, but it might as well be. Trance is old enough to have one now, like House and Techno are. And the reason why is because this music encapsulates what I think of when I hear the word trance. Music that rewards paying attention and looking inward, on a meditative level. Music that you can get lost in. Parties that last several days, and songs that last 8 hours. You don't hear that anymore. Today Trance is either a sequence of disjointed, disaffected, unrelated predictable anthems laid out one after the other (hardly entrancing), or is completely overshadowed and drowned out by the posturing and hero-worship of people who really do nothing more than operate a glorified stereo.
