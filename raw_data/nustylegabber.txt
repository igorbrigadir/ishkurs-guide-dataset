text=NU Style gabber is not new, because it's been around for a good six or seven years now, but the Official Electronic Music Genre Standards and Classifications Consortium is really slow on updating and re-naming existing genres (oh, but boy do they ever love coming up with new ones). Taking a page from Jump Up Jungle and Epic Trance, Nu Style is full of the same kind of anthemic, hands-in-the-air enthusiasm. Christ, some tracks even employ the breakdown-build-anthem formula. Hardcore purists hate this shit, because naturally something this sacharine (for hardcore) is going to attract the trendies. Especially since in the last couple of years this and Hard Trance seem to be merging into one all-encompassing "thunderous beat with blaring hoovers" genre: Hardstyle.
