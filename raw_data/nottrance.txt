text=If I roll my eyes any harder, they're going to fall right out of their sockets. As a good friend of mine once said: "Come on. Get on with it already. I can only hold my arms in the air for so long." Let it be said that electronic music NEVER learns how to 'leave the audience wanting more'. Instead, like a spoiled, immature little child, it shamelessly and greedily exploits any whiff of success it sees, to cartoonish extremes. Which is why we have this. Yeah, I know. It sounds like a really bad and corny Hollywood love scene, doesn't it? Somehow, a mutant form of trance evolved from Epic drenched itself in the breakdown-build-anthem formula and senselessly driven it to new, insane levels of assinine. In doing so, it stopped becoming trance. Some songs have ridiculously long and drawn out breakdowns, lasting well over 3 minutes or almost half the length of the entire fucking track. Each new release tries to outdo last week's hit anthem, reaching higher and higher, making the genre louder, fuller, and more exalted and grandiose. Good god, does this ever suck. The way megatrance producers shamelessly cash in on a particular sound is insulting sometimes. How can anyone take this trite, derivative garbage seriously? What the hell is this, anyway? It's bombastic melodrama; a pompous, over-the-top, monstrously grotesque caricature of what trance used to be. The final betrayal. Trance is dead. Ferry Corsten killed it.
