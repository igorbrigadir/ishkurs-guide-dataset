text=Summed up: the Audio Blueprint label. This stuff fucking rules! Electro meets Drum n bass, or what happens to drumnbass when you add the lovable TB-303 to it. Digitized synths and ominous tones giving it that ultra-cool, spacey, sci-fi ethereal feel, with samples of light sabers and Tie fighters or quotes from movies like Pi or Gattaca. Easily the coolest thing I've ever heard to come out of drumnbass in recent years. The only thing it's missing is spooky theremin sounds, but I bet there's someone out there who's making that as I speak.
