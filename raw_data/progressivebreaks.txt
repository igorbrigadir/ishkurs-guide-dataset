text=Yes, of course. House and Trance have it, so Breakbeat must have it too. The truth is I have no fucking clue what Progressive Breaks are, and after scouring thousands of sites, mailing lists, tracks, artists, labels, and embraced more acid-tongued, haughty opinions than a black guy at a KKK meeting, I've come to the conclusion that nobody else really knows what Progressive Breaks are either. Which is just as well, because the word seems to make music snobs want to talk out of their asses more than usual.....by accompanying it with other words like "forward thinking" and "innovative" and "groundbreaking". As near as I can figure, Progressive Breaks are one part Breaktrance, one part Nu Skool breaks, one part Ambient Breaks, and the rest is stubborn sophism.
