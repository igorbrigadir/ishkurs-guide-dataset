text=The British music press really only call it this. Everywhere else it's just seen as another welcome addition to the post-hip hop, downtempo breakbeat movement. Everything ambienty and jazzy included. Only this is reeeeeeeaaaaaalllly slooooooooooowww, with female vocals that don't sing insomuch as they just droll around like they quaffed too many quaaludes. Bristol seems to churn out artists the way Seattle churns out grunge bands. I don't find it as fun as the others, though. Leave it to the brits to dullify yet another promising strain of music.
