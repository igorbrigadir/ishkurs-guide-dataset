text=Everything comes full circle, thanx to the power of Retro. After Electro ran its course was a lulling period, and then it came back with improved equipment, called Nu Electro. Soon it will die out too, and then there will be another lulling period, and it will return once again as Nu Nu Electro, with even better equipment. Personally, I can't wait until Nu Nu Nu Electro comes. That right there's gonna be some pretty tight shit. I bet by then machines will be making most of the world's music. So naturally Electro is going to be all over the place.
