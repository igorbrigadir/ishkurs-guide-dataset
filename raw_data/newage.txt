text=New Age. Wow. What can be said about New Age. To start, this likes to cling onto the western post-modern meditative-yoga-pilates-tai chi new age baby boomer pop philosophies trend and not let go (hence the name: New Age). That should give you a hint right there that anyone who thinks The Celestine Prophecy is a good book has the worst taste in music. Unlike Ambient, there is singing here, not all of which are celtic chants, choir crooning or aboriginal jibber-jabber (that's mostly Worldbeat stuff anyway). New Age is floaty, dreamy, and effeminate--even the stuff made by the guys (who have no genitals, by the way). If you have trouble finding it in your local music store, that's because it's in the ADULT CONTEMPORARY section....yeah, beside Celine Dion and Phil Collins, Jesus Christ. The music itself isn't actually all that bad, but the people who listen to it are fucking tools. It's really hard to find a New Age composer these days that you wouldn't wanna rather give a swift kick in the shins.
