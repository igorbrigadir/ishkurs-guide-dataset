text=Every song is exactly the same!!!! EVERY GOD DAMN FUCKING SONG!!! The only thing that changes is the stupid rolling basslines--and not by much. Heh. This is worse than Anthem Trance in its predictability, its formulaicness, its dilapidated sense of value or worth. I once thought of making an Aphrodite music generator where you choose your hip hop sample, your intro scratch, and then your bassline, hit the "mix" button and away you go: insta jump up tune. Making music out of templates is boring, guys. Stop it already.
