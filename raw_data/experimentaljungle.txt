text=This stuff is so fucked up, sometimes my head explodes when I listen to it. A cacophony of unique sounds, snares, rolls, and complicated drum patterns makes this one of those genres you have to acquire a taste for. It blurs a lot with IDM, so expect to see artists making ample amounts of both. The difference between the two? One sounds more fucked up than the other. It's up to you, however, to figure out which one that is.
