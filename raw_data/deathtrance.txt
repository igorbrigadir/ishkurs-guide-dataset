text=Dark Trance and Death Trance are pretty interchangeable. The only real difference (and it's a minor one...oh, but isn't this entire guide?) is that Death Trance artists seemed to be ported over from Hardcore a lot, whereas Dark Trance artists are ported over from Goa. But not always. Speaking of Goa, this music sounds a lot like it and can be mixed with it really well, and it scares the hippies away too, so it gets the big *thumbs up* by me.
