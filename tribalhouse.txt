text=I'm probably splitting hairs here by describing each and every flavour of tribal when it could be much more easily sorted out as just one percussive whole, but some people have really narrow tastes, so this guide is not for them. Tribal House is mostly a west coast thing, where we still have trees out here for hippies to hang out in and throw free parties in the forests during the summer (when the weather cooperates). Plenty of bongs and bongo drums for everybody.
