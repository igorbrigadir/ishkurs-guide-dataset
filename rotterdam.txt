text=Gabber, or 'Gabba' as it's affectiontely known, is Dutch or Flemish or some fucked up European lowlands euphemism for "friend" or as they like to call it "mate". It is always slower and more cheesy than the North American variety. It became hooligan music in the mid 90s as its catchy hoover anthems are tailor-made for soccer stadium chants and war-beating. North American sports are quite primitive insofar as fan traditions are concerned (yeah, like 20 year old AC/DC songs are the pinnacle of male bonding), so the music had to find a different audience. Namely, disaffected college students trying too hard to be different and angst-ridden, testosterone-fueled juvenile delinquents pooled over from death metal. The music is really quite harmless, though.
